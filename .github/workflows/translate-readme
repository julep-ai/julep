        Use the root README.md to review the .github/README-{lang}.md files
        to see if they are correctly translated and if needed
        make changes as necessary. Keep the contents exactly the same, just
        translated to the target languages.

      custom_instructions: >-
        This is a monorepo with multiple different services.
        The repo uses AGENTS.md as the file that contains instructions for
        AI agents (instead of CLAUDE.md files). CLAUDE.md still exists but
        is just a symlink to the corresponding AGENTS.md (usually in the same dir).
