## Understanding the Codebase

To get a comprehensive understanding of Julep, we recommend exploring the codebase in the following order:

1. **Project Overview**
   - Read `README.md` in the root directory
   - Explore `docs/` for detailed documentation

2. **System Architecture**
   - Examine `docker-compose.yml` in the root directory
   - Review `deploy/` directory for different deployment configurations

3. **API Specifications**
   - Learn about TypeSpec: https://typespec.io/docs/
   - Explore `typespec/` directory:
     - Start with `common/` folder
     - Review `main.tsp`
     - Examine each module sequentially

4. **Core API Implementation**
   - Learn about FastAPI: https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/
   - Explore `agents-api/` directory:
     - Review `README.md` for an overview
     - Examine `routers/` for API endpoints
     - Look into `models/` for data models

5. **Database and Storage**
   - Learn about Cozo: https://docs.cozodb.org/en/latest/tutorial.html
   - Review `agents-api/README.md` for database schema
   - Explore `agents-api/models/` for database queries

6. **Workflow Management**
   - Learn about Temporal: https://docs.temporal.io/develop/python
   - Explore `agents-api/activities/` for individual workflow steps
   - Review `agents-api/workflows/task_execution/` for main workflow logic

7. **Testing**
   - Examine `agents-api/tests/` for test cases

8. **Additional Services**
   - Explore other service directories (`integrations-service/`, `embedding-service/`, etc.) to understand their specific roles and implementations

### Adding a New Integration

The integration service is a crucial part of Julep, and we welcome contributions from the community to enhance its functionality and capabilities.

To contribute to the integration service, you can follow these steps:

1. **Add a new integration provider to our TypeSpec:** You can do so by:
   1. Adding the provider name to the `integrationProvider` alias in `typespec/tools/models.tsp`
   2. Adding a new file in `typespec/tools/` with the provider name. Take a look at the other integration files in the `typespec/tools/` directory for examples.

      > If the integration needs an API key or other form of authentication, you would have to add a `Setup` model to the integration definition file, where you would define the authentication parameters (`spider.tsp` is an example of this). Otherwise, you can omit the `Setup` model (`wikipedia.tsp` is an example of this).

2. **Generate the new OpenAPI schema and Pydantic models:** You need to `cd` into the root directory of the project and run `./scripts/generate_openapi_code.sh` to generate the new OpenAPI schema along with Pydantic models for the new changes.

   > The new OpenAPI schema will be generated in `./openapi.yaml` and the Pydantic models will be generated in `./integrations-service/integrations/autogen`. 

3. **Add the new integration logic in the integration service:** You need to add the new integration logic in the integration service by adding a new file in `integration-service/integrations/utils/integrations` with the provider name. Take a look at the other integration files in the same directory for examples.

4. **Add the new integration provider to the providers registry:** You need to add the new integration provider to the providers registry by adding a new entry to the `available_providers` dictionary in `integrations-service/integrations/providers.py`.

### Documentation Improvements
