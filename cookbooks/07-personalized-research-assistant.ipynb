I solve a growth-\\\\n                       drift-diﬀusion-absorption model of such a mangled worlds scenario, and show that it\\\\n                       reproduces the Born probability rule closely, though not exactly. Thus deviations from\\\\n                       exact decoherence can allow the Born rule to be derived in a many worlds approach\\\\n                       via world counting, using a ﬁnite number of worlds and no new fundamental physics.\\\\n\\\\n               Introduction\\\\n               Traditional quantum mechanics suﬀers from many ambiguities regarding quantum measure-\\\\n               ments. Many worlds approaches try to resolve these ambiguities by identifying measurements\\\\n               with decoherence events produced by standard linear quantum evolution [1, 2]. In such\\\\n               events, oﬀ-diagonal density matrix elements are often naturally and dramatically suppressed\\\\n               due to coupling with a large environment [3].\\\\n                    Unfortunately, the many worlds approach still suﬀers from the problem that, when there\\\\n               are a ﬁnite number of worlds, the straightforward way to calculate probabilities, i.e., counting\\\\n               the fraction of worlds with a given outcome, does not produce the standard Born probability\\\\n               rule [4, 5]. Some have tried to resolve this by adding new fundamental physics, such as\\\\n               non-linear dynamics [6], or an inﬁnity of worlds per quantum state which diverge via an\\\\n               unknown process [7]. Others propose new decision theory axioms saying we do not care\\\\n               about the number of worlds that see an outcome [8, 9].\\\\n                    A mangled worlds variation proposes to resolve the Born rule problem using only as-\\\\n               sumptions that are about the behavior of standard linear quantum evolution, assumptions\\\\n               that can in principle be checked by theoretical analysis of common quantum systems. The\\\\n               idea is that decoherence is never exact, and so while decoherence makes oﬀ-diagonal terms\\\\n               small relative to a large world, they can be large relative to a small enough world. This\\\\n               may plausibly mangle very small worlds, either destroying the observers in such worlds, or\\\\n               changing them into observers who remember events from large worlds [10].\\\\n                   ∗rhanson@gmu.edu http://hanson.gmu.edu 703-993-2326 FAX: 703-993-2323 MSN 1D3, Carow Hall, Fair-\\\\n               fax VA 22030\\\\n\\\\n                                                                         1', 'mimetype': 'text/plain', 'start_char_idx': None, 'end_char_idx': None, 'text_template': '{metadata_str}\\\\n\\\\n{content}', 'metadata_template': '{key}: {value}', 'metadata_seperator': '\\\\n', 'class_name': 'Document'}, {'doc_id': 'b73cbea4-a0a4-47de-9122-4acbfcba2d85', 'embedding': None, 'extra_info': {'file_name': 'Drift-Diffusion in Mangled Worlds Quantum Mechanics'}, 'excluded_embed_metadata_keys': [], 'excluded_llm_metadata_keys': [], 'relationships': {}, 'text': '                 This paper presents an explicit growth-drift-diﬀusion-absorption model of such a mangled\\\\nworlds scenario. It assumes that mangling is a sudden irreversible process, that typical\\\\nexperimental tests of the Born rule include many uncounted background decoherence events,\\\\nand that the region in world size where worlds become mangled is relatively narrow and\\\\nlocated near the median of the distribution of measure. Closed form expressions are given\\\\nshowing that the Born rule is followed closely, though not exactly, in this model. Thus most\\\\nunmangled worlds would remember having observed frequencies very near that predicted by\\\\nthe Born rule, even though in fact Born frequencies do not apply to the vast majority of\\\\nworlds, and even though such frequencies are not observed in the very largest worlds.\\\\n\\\\nDrift-Diﬀusion Of All Worlds\\\\nConsider a single initial unit-magnitude world that repeatedly undergoes decoherence events\\\\ne. (And for now ignore world mangling.) During each event e, each pre-existing world i\\\\nsplits into a set J(i, e) of resulting worlds j, each of which gets some fraction Fjie of the\\\\noriginal world’s measure. That is, if mi is the measure (or size) of world i, then mj = Fjiem,\\\\n where∑j∈J(i,e) Fjie = 1. Assume that these fractions do not depend on the particular world                                                                                                          i\\\\n being split, so that Fjie = Fje and J(i, e) = J(e). If so, then after there have been enough\\\\n events so that the variance of each set {ln(Fje)}j∈J(e) is small compared to this summed over\\\\n e, the central limit theorem of statistics ensures that the resulting set of worlds will approach\\\\n a log-normal distribution over measure m.\\\\n                 In terms of log size x = ln(m), the distribution of worlds would be normal with some\\\\n mean ~                                                                           x < 0 and standard deviation σ > 0.

However, in the models that have been solved so far,\\\\ncoherence ϵ(t) typically eventually asymptotes to a small but non-zero level [3, 11, 12, 13].\\\\nworlds increases as eσ = e√wt. As discussed elsewhere [10], if ϵ(t) eventually falls slower\\\\n                                                                                           As we have seen in the previous section, the relative magnitude between any two random\\\\nthan this rate, then eventually the oﬀ diagonal terms ρsL and ρLs must greatly inﬂuence the\\\\nevolution of the smaller diagonal term ρss, even though these oﬀ diagonal terms have little\\\\ninﬂuence on and are mainly driven by the larger diagonal term ρLL. Thus the evolution\\\\nof smaller worlds is eventually driven by larger worlds, plausibly “mangling” those smaller\\\\nworlds, i.e., either destroying their observers or turning them into observers who remember\\\\noutcomes from a large world. Remaining observers would thus only remember the histories\\\\nof unmangled worlds.\\\\n    Let us conjecture that the mangling of worlds is a sudden, irreversible, and global process.\\\\nSpeciﬁcally, let us assume that there is a mangling region in world size, so that a world that\\\\nhas always remained larger than this region remains unmangled, and that a world that\\\\nwas once smaller than this region became suddenly and forevermore mangled. Let us also\\\\nconjecture that the relevant standard deviation σ is the result of many decoherence events,\\\\nmost of which are not counted in experiment tests. This suggests that the mangling region\\\\nis relatively narrow compared to σ. Finally, let us assume that since it is the measure of\\\\nsome worlds that mangles other worlds, this mangling region remains close to the median\\\\nmeasure ^ that would describe the distribution of all worlds were there no mangling.                                                                                               x\\\\n    If unmangled worlds evolve locally just as all worlds would were there no mangling,\\\\nand if initially all worlds are unmangled, then the distribution μ1(x, t) of unmangled worlds\\\\nshould satisfy equations 2 and 3, just as the distribution μ0(x, t) of all worlds under the no\\\\nmangling assumption. To model our assumption of a mangling region narrow compared to σ\\\\nand remaining close to the median measure ^ = −(v − w)t, let us impose on the unmangled                                                                                               x\\\\ndistribution μ1(x, t) the additional boundary condition\\\\n\\\\n                                                 μ(xb(t), t) = 0,                                                  (4)\\\\nfor all t ≥ 0, where xb(t) = ^ − ϵ, ϵ > 0, and we limit our attention to x ≥ xb(t).

To predict our existence in an ummangled\\\\nworld, the mangled worlds approach must predict that v > w.\\\\n\\\\n Born Rule Accuracy\\\\n How well does this diﬀusion process reproduce the Born rule? Let each distinct measurement\\\\n outcome k be associated with a set of Gk > 1 child worlds per parent world, each of which\\\\nis a factor Fk < 1 smaller than its parent. The Born rule says that the probability of an\\\\noutcome is given by FkGk. To see how closely does this mangled worlds approach conforms\\\\nwith the Born rule, let us calculate the number of unmangled worlds as associated with such\\\\nan experimental outcome.\\\\n                 Speciﬁcally, starting at time t = 0 let a single unmangled world of size y = ϵ (relative\\\\nto the mangling region at y = 0) evolve into a distribution μ(y, t1; ϵ) at time t1, where\\\\n1 ≪ wt1 ≫ ϵ. This is not intended to be the distribution of all worlds, but rather the\\\\ndistribution of all worlds consistent with the initial conditions of a given experiment to test\\\\nthe Born rule. It is the result of decoherence events both during and before the experiment,\\\\nevents that are not counted in the statistics of the experiment. Given what we know about\\\\nthe experiment, we do not know which of these worlds we are in, and so we must average\\\\nover these worlds when making experimental predictions.\\\\n                 At time t1, let each world with value y1 in μ(y, t1; ϵ) be split into G ≥ 1 worlds, each of\\\\nwhich is a factor F ≤ 1 smaller, so that it has the value y = y1 + ln(F ). Let each of these\\\\nworlds then evolve to produce more worlds over a longer time period t2 ≫ t1. For the Born\\\\n rule to apply exactly, the number of unmangled worlds in the ﬁnal distribution at time t2\\\\n should go as F G. (It would not contradict observations if the Born rule were violated soon\\\\n after t1, in worlds that were not mangled but were about to become mangled. What we\\\\n actually observe are long-existing historical records of experiments testing the Born rule.)\\\\n                 With a little help from Mathematica, the ﬁnal unmangled world count is found to be\\\\n               λ(F, G; t1, t2, ϵ) ≡ G∫ ∞W (t2; y)μ(y − ln(F ), t1; ϵ)dy\\\\n                                                                                                                                     0                                                  ⎛√\\\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   ⌈√wt2⎝⎜ .        ⌉⎜\\\\n                                                                                                  = F G erfc(− ln(F ))ϵeϵe(v−w)(t1 +t)⎛                                                                                                            √2wt1                      2  2\\\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                              − ewt/2erfc⎜\\\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                               2\\\\n                                                                                                                                                         4\\\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                    πwt2                                                    2\\\\nThe key thing to notice here is that when wt1 is large, the Born rule correction\\\\n\\\\n                                                                                                                                                                    5', 'mimetype': 'text/plain', 'start_char_idx': None, 'end_char_idx': None, 'text_template': '{metadata_str}\\\\n\\\\n{content}', 'metadata_template': '{key}: {value}', 'metadata_seperator': '\\\\n', 'class_name': 'Document'}, {'doc_id': '8c1ff388-1f1c-4891-9989-be8deff5f0de', 'embedding': None, 'extra_info': {'file_name': 'Drift-Diffusion in Mangled Worlds Quantum Mechanics'}, 'excluded_embed_metadata_keys': [], 'excluded_llm_metadata_keys': [], 'relationships': {}, 'text': '                                                                                                          γ(F, G) ≡ 1                                               λ(F, G; t, t2, ϵ)\\\\n                                                                                                                                                                                     λ(1, 1; t1, t2, ϵ) = erfc(− ln(F )).                                      1  √2wt1\\\\n                                                                                                                                                F G\\\\nchanges very slowly in the factor F .

Under this scenario, inexact decoherence results in larger worlds suddenly\\\\nand irreversibly mangling any worlds that reach a narrow region in world size. Closed form\\\\nexpressions are given showing that this model reproduces the Born rule closely, but not\\\\nexactly.

Thus deviations from\\\\n                       exact decoherence can allow the Born rule to be derived in a many worlds approach\\\\n                       via world counting, using a ﬁnite number of worlds and no new fundamental physics.\\\\n\\\\n               Introduction\\\\n               Traditional quantum mechanics suﬀers from many ambiguities regarding quantum measure-\\\\n               ments. Many worlds approaches try to resolve these ambiguities by identifying measurements\\\\n               with decoherence events produced by standard linear quantum evolution [1, 2]. In such\\\\n               events, oﬀ-diagonal density matrix elements are often naturally and dramatically suppressed\\\\n               due to coupling with a large environment [3].\\\\n                    Unfortunately, the many worlds approach still suﬀers from the problem that, when there\\\\n               are a ﬁnite number of worlds, the straightforward way to calculate probabilities, i.e., counting\\\\n               the fraction of worlds with a given outcome, does not produce the standard Born probability\\\\n               rule [4, 5]. Some have tried to resolve this by adding new fundamental physics, such as\\\\n               non-linear dynamics [6], or an inﬁnity of worlds per quantum state which diverge via an\\\\n               unknown process [7]. Others propose new decision theory axioms saying we do not care\\\\n               about the number of worlds that see an outcome [8, 9].\\\\n                    A mangled worlds variation proposes to resolve the Born rule problem using only as-\\\\n               sumptions that are about the behavior of standard linear quantum evolution, assumptions\\\\n               that can in principle be checked by theoretical analysis of common quantum systems. The\\\\n               idea is that decoherence is never exact, and so while decoherence makes oﬀ-diagonal terms\\\\n               small relative to a large world, they can be large relative to a small enough world. This\\\\n               may plausibly mangle very small worlds, either destroying the observers in such worlds, or\\\\n               changing them into observers who remember events from large worlds [10].\\\\n                   ∗rhanson@gmu.edu http://hanson.gmu.edu 703-993-2326 FAX: 703-993-2323 MSN 1D3, Carow Hall, Fair-\\\\n               fax VA 22030\\\\n\\\\n                                                                         1', 'mimetype': 'text/plain', 'start_char_idx': None, 'end_char_idx': None, 'text_template': '{metadata_str}\\\\n\\\\n{content}', 'metadata_template': '{key}: {value}', 'metadata_seperator': '\\\\n', 'class_name': 'Document'}, {'doc_id': 'b73cbea4-a0a4-47de-9122-4acbfcba2d85', 'embedding': None, 'extra_info': {'file_name': 'Drift-Diffusion in Mangled Worlds Quantum Mechanics'}, 'excluded_embed_metadata_keys': [], 'excluded_llm_metadata_keys': [], 'relationships': {}, 'text': '                 This paper presents an explicit growth-drift-diﬀusion-absorption model of such a mangled\\\\nworlds scenario.

Closed form expressions are given\\\\nshowing that the Born rule is followed closely, though not exactly, in this model.

(And for now ignore world mangling.) During each event e, each pre-existing world i\\\\nsplits into a set J(i, e) of resulting worlds j, each of which gets some fraction Fjie of the\\\\noriginal world’s measure.

Speciﬁcally, given two worlds, large L and small s, we have\\\\n\\\\n                                             |ρLs|2 ≤ ϵ2(t)|ρLL||ρss|,\\\\nwhere |ρab| ≡ 〈 a |ρab| b 〉, and coherence ϵ(t) typically falls at a rapid exponential rate for\\\\na great many doubling times [3]. However, in the models that have been solved so far,\\\\ncoherence ϵ(t) typically eventually asymptotes to a small but non-zero level [3, 11, 12, 13].\\\\nworlds increases as eσ = e√wt. As discussed elsewhere [10], if ϵ(t) eventually falls slower\\\\n                                                                                           As we have seen in the previous section, the relative magnitude between any two random\\\\nthan this rate, then eventually the oﬀ diagonal terms ρsL and ρLs must greatly inﬂuence the\\\\nevolution of the smaller diagonal term ρss, even though these oﬀ diagonal terms have little\\\\ninﬂuence on and are mainly driven by the larger diagonal term ρLL. Thus the evolution\\\\nof smaller worlds is eventually driven by larger worlds, plausibly “mangling” those smaller\\\\nworlds, i.e., either destroying their observers or turning them into observers who remember\\\\noutcomes from a large world. Remaining observers would thus only remember the histories\\\\nof unmangled worlds.\\\\n    Let us conjecture that the mangling of worlds is a sudden, irreversible, and global process.\\\\nSpeciﬁcally, let us assume that there is a mangling region in world size, so that a world that\\\\nhas always remained larger than this region remains unmangled, and that a world that\\\\nwas once smaller than this region became suddenly and forevermore mangled. Let us also\\\\nconjecture that the relevant standard deviation σ is the result of many decoherence events,\\\\nmost of which are not counted in experiment tests. This suggests that the mangling region\\\\nis relatively narrow compared to σ. Finally, let us assume that since it is the measure of\\\\nsome worlds that mangles other worlds, this mangling region remains close to the median\\\\nmeasure ^ that would describe the distribution of all worlds were there no mangling.                                                                                               x\\\\n    If unmangled worlds evolve locally just as all worlds would were there no mangling,\\\\nand if initially all worlds are unmangled, then the distribution μ1(x, t) of unmangled worlds\\\\nshould satisfy equations 2 and 3, just as the distribution μ0(x, t) of all worlds under the no\\\\nmangling assumption. To model our assumption of a mangling region narrow compared to σ\\\\nand remaining close to the median measure ^ = −(v − w)t, let us impose on the unmangled                                                                                               x\\\\ndistribution μ1(x, t) the additional boundary condition\\\\n\\\\n                                                 μ(xb(t), t) = 0,                                                  (4)\\\\nfor all t ≥ 0, where xb(t) = ^ − ϵ, ϵ > 0, and we limit our attention to x ≥ xb(t).

To predict our existence in an ummangled\\\\nworld, the mangled worlds approach must predict that v > w.\\\\n\\\\n Born Rule Accuracy\\\\n How well does this diﬀusion process reproduce the Born rule? Let each distinct measurement\\\\n outcome k be associated with a set of Gk > 1 child worlds per parent world, each of which\\\\nis a factor Fk < 1 smaller than its parent. The Born rule says that the probability of an\\\\noutcome is given by FkGk. To see how closely does this mangled worlds approach conforms\\\\nwith the Born rule, let us calculate the number of unmangled worlds as associated with such\\\\nan experimental outcome.\\\\n                 Speciﬁcally, starting at time t = 0 let a single unmangled world of size y = ϵ (relative\\\\nto the mangling region at y = 0) evolve into a distribution μ(y, t1; ϵ) at time t1, where\\\\n1 ≪ wt1 ≫ ϵ. This is not intended to be the distribution of all worlds, but rather the\\\\ndistribution of all worlds consistent with the initial conditions of a given experiment to test\\\\nthe Born rule. It is the result of decoherence events both during and before the experiment,\\\\nevents that are not counted in the statistics of the experiment. Given what we know about\\\\nthe experiment, we do not know which of these worlds we are in, and so we must average\\\\nover these worlds when making experimental predictions.\\\\n                 At time t1, let each world with value y1 in μ(y, t1; ϵ) be split into G ≥ 1 worlds, each of\\\\nwhich is a factor F ≤ 1 smaller, so that it has the value y = y1 + ln(F ). Let each of these\\\\nworlds then evolve to produce more worlds over a longer time period t2 ≫ t1. For the Born\\\\n rule to apply exactly, the number of unmangled worlds in the ﬁnal distribution at time t2\\\\n should go as F G. (It would not contradict observations if the Born rule were violated soon\\\\n after t1, in worlds that were not mangled but were about to become mangled. What we\\\\n actually observe are long-existing historical records of experiments testing the Born rule.)\\\\n                 With a little help from Mathematica, the ﬁnal unmangled world count is found to be\\\\n               λ(F, G; t1, t2, ϵ) ≡ G∫ ∞W (t2; y)μ(y − ln(F ), t1; ϵ)dy\\\\n                                                                                                                                     0                                                  ⎛√\\\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   ⌈√wt2⎝⎜ .        ⌉⎜\\\\n                                                                                                  = F G erfc(− ln(F ))ϵeϵe(v−w)(t1 +t)⎛                                                                                                            √2wt1                      2  2\\\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                              − ewt/2erfc⎜\\\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                               2\\\\n                                                                                                                                                         4\\\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                    πwt2                                                    2\\\\nThe key thing to notice here is that when wt1 is large, the Born rule correction\\\\n\\\\n                                                                                                                                                                    5', 'mimetype': 'text/plain', 'start_char_idx': None, 'end_char_idx': None, 'text_template': '{metadata_str}\\\\n\\\\n{content}', 'metadata_template': '{key}: {value}', 'metadata_seperator': '\\\\n', 'class_name': 'Document'}, {'doc_id': '8c1ff388-1f1c-4891-9989-be8deff5f0de', 'embedding': None, 'extra_info': {'file_name': 'Drift-Diffusion in Mangled Worlds Quantum Mechanics'}, 'excluded_embed_metadata_keys': [], 'excluded_llm_metadata_keys': [], 'relationships': {}, 'text': '                                                                                                          γ(F, G) ≡ 1                                               λ(F, G; t, t2, ϵ)\\\\n                                                                                                                                                                                     λ(1, 1; t1, t2, ϵ) = erfc(− ln(F )).                                      1  √2wt1\\\\n                                                                                                                                                F G\\\\nchanges very slowly in the factor F .

Under this scenario, inexact decoherence results in larger worlds suddenly\\\\nand irreversibly mangling any worlds that reach a narrow region in world size. Closed form\\\\nexpressions are given showing that this model reproduces the Born rule closely, but not\\\\nexactly. Thus most unmangled observers would remember having observed nearly Born\\\\nfrequencies, allowing us to reconcile the many worlds approach with the Born rule without\\\\ninvoking new fundamental physics or decision theory axioms.\\\\n\\\\nReferences\\\\n    [1] H.

Thus deviations from\\n                       exact decoherence can allow the Born rule to be derived in a many worlds approach\\n                       via world counting, using a ﬁnite number of worlds and no new fundamental physics.\\n\\n               Introduction\\n               Traditional quantum mechanics suﬀers from many ambiguities regarding quantum measure-\\n               ments. Many worlds approaches try to resolve these ambiguities by identifying measurements\\n               with decoherence events produced by standard linear quantum evolution [1, 2]. In such\\n               events, oﬀ-diagonal density matrix elements are often naturally and dramatically suppressed\\n               due to coupling with a large environment [3].\\n                    Unfortunately, the many worlds approach still suﬀers from the problem that, when there\\n               are a ﬁnite number of worlds, the straightforward way to calculate probabilities, i.e., counting\\n               the fraction of worlds with a given outcome, does not produce the standard Born probability\\n               rule [4, 5]. Some have tried to resolve this by adding new fundamental physics, such as\\n               non-linear dynamics [6], or an inﬁnity of worlds per quantum state which diverge via an\\n               unknown process [7]. Others propose new decision theory axioms saying we do not care\\n               about the number of worlds that see an outcome [8, 9].\\n                    A mangled worlds variation proposes to resolve the Born rule problem using only as-\\n               sumptions that are about the behavior of standard linear quantum evolution, assumptions\\n               that can in principle be checked by theoretical analysis of common quantum systems. The\\n               idea is that decoherence is never exact, and so while decoherence makes oﬀ-diagonal terms\\n               small relative to a large world, they can be large relative to a small enough world. This\\n               may plausibly mangle very small worlds, either destroying the observers in such worlds, or\\n               changing them into observers who remember events from large worlds [10].\\n                   ∗rhanson@gmu.edu http://hanson.gmu.edu 703-993-2326 FAX: 703-993-2323 MSN 1D3, Carow Hall, Fair-\\n               fax VA 22030\\n\\n                                                                         1', 'doc_id': 'fec0c160-bb07-4eea-be2e-897fd057d647', 'mimetype': 'text/plain', 'embedding': None, 'class_name': 'Document', 'extra_info': {'file_name': 'Drift-Diffusion in Mangled Worlds Quantum Mechanics'}, 'end_char_idx': None, 'relationships': {}, 'text_template': '{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', 'start_char_idx': None, 'metadata_template': '{key}: {value}', 'metadata_seperator': '\\n', 'excluded_llm_metadata_keys': [], 'excluded_embed_metadata_keys': []}, {'text': '                 This paper presents an explicit growth-drift-diﬀusion-absorption model of such a mangled\\nworlds scenario.

However, in the models that have been solved so far,\\ncoherence ϵ(t) typically eventually asymptotes to a small but non-zero level [3, 11, 12, 13].\\nworlds increases as eσ = e√wt. As discussed elsewhere [10], if ϵ(t) eventually falls slower\\n                                                                                           As we have seen in the previous section, the relative magnitude between any two random\\nthan this rate, then eventually the oﬀ diagonal terms ρsL and ρLs must greatly inﬂuence the\\nevolution of the smaller diagonal term ρss, even though these oﬀ diagonal terms have little\\ninﬂuence on and are mainly driven by the larger diagonal term ρLL. Thus the evolution\\nof smaller worlds is eventually driven by larger worlds, plausibly “mangling” those smaller\\nworlds, i.e., either destroying their observers or turning them into observers who remember\\noutcomes from a large world. Remaining observers would thus only remember the histories\\nof unmangled worlds.\\n    Let us conjecture that the mangling of worlds is a sudden, irreversible, and global process.\\nSpeciﬁcally, let us assume that there is a mangling region in world size, so that a world that\\nhas always remained larger than this region remains unmangled, and that a world that\\nwas once smaller than this region became suddenly and forevermore mangled. Let us also\\nconjecture that the relevant standard deviation σ is the result of many decoherence events,\\nmost of which are not counted in experiment tests. This suggests that the mangling region\\nis relatively narrow compared to σ. Finally, let us assume that since it is the measure of\\nsome worlds that mangles other worlds, this mangling region remains close to the median\\nmeasure ^ that would describe the distribution of all worlds were there no mangling.                                                                                               x\\n    If unmangled worlds evolve locally just as all worlds would were there no mangling,\\nand if initially all worlds are unmangled, then the distribution μ1(x, t) of unmangled worlds\\nshould satisfy equations 2 and 3, just as the distribution μ0(x, t) of all worlds under the no\\nmangling assumption.

To predict our existence in an ummangled\\nworld, the mangled worlds approach must predict that v > w.\\n\\n Born Rule Accuracy\\n How well does this diﬀusion process reproduce the Born rule? Let each distinct measurement\\n outcome k be associated with a set of Gk > 1 child worlds per parent world, each of which\\nis a factor Fk < 1 smaller than its parent. The Born rule says that the probability of an\\noutcome is given by FkGk. To see how closely does this mangled worlds approach conforms\\nwith the Born rule, let us calculate the number of unmangled worlds as associated with such\\nan experimental outcome.\\n                 Speciﬁcally, starting at time t = 0 let a single unmangled world of size y = ϵ (relative\\nto the mangling region at y = 0) evolve into a distribution μ(y, t1; ϵ) at time t1, where\\n1 ≪ wt1 ≫ ϵ. This is not intended to be the distribution of all worlds, but rather the\\ndistribution of all worlds consistent with the initial conditions of a given experiment to test\\nthe Born rule. It is the result of decoherence events both during and before the experiment,\\nevents that are not counted in the statistics of the experiment. Given what we know about\\nthe experiment, we do not know which of these worlds we are in, and so we must average\\nover these worlds when making experimental predictions.\\n                 At time t1, let each world with value y1 in μ(y, t1; ϵ) be split into G ≥ 1 worlds, each of\\nwhich is a factor F ≤ 1 smaller, so that it has the value y = y1 + ln(F ). Let each of these\\nworlds then evolve to produce more worlds over a longer time period t2 ≫ t1. For the Born\\n rule to apply exactly, the number of unmangled worlds in the ﬁnal distribution at time t2\\n should go as F G. (It would not contradict observations if the Born rule were violated soon\\n after t1, in worlds that were not mangled but were about to become mangled. What we\\n actually observe are long-existing historical records of experiments testing the Born rule.)\\n                 With a little help from Mathematica, the ﬁnal unmangled world count is found to be\\n               λ(F, G; t1, t2, ϵ) ≡ G∫ ∞W (t2; y)μ(y − ln(F ), t1; ϵ)dy\\n                                                                                                                                     0                                                  ⎛√\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   ⌈√wt2⎝⎜ .        ⌉⎜\\n                                                                                                  = F G erfc(− ln(F ))ϵeϵe(v−w)(t1 +t)⎛                                                                                                            √2wt1                      2  2\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                              − ewt/2erfc⎜\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                               2\\n                                                                                                                                                         4\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                    πwt2                                                    2\\nThe key thing to notice here is that when wt1 is large, the Born rule correction\\n\\n                                                                                                                                                                    5', 'doc_id': 'ed033f74-b0e9-437e-a53e-bb3a1d2f3693', 'mimetype': 'text/plain', 'embedding': None, 'class_name': 'Document', 'extra_info': {'file_name': 'Drift-Diffusion in Mangled Worlds Quantum Mechanics'}, 'end_char_idx': None, 'relationships': {}, 'text_template': '{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', 'start_char_idx': None, 'metadata_template': '{key}: {value}', 'metadata_seperator': '\\n', 'excluded_llm_metadata_keys': [], 'excluded_embed_metadata_keys': []}, {'text': '                                                                                                          γ(F, G) ≡ 1                                               λ(F, G; t, t2, ϵ)\\n                                                                                                                                                                                     λ(1, 1; t1, t2, ϵ) = erfc(− ln(F )).                                      1  √2wt1\\n                                                                                                                                                F G\\nchanges very slowly in the factor F .

Under this scenario, inexact decoherence results in larger worlds suddenly\\nand irreversibly mangling any worlds that reach a narrow region in world size. Closed form\\nexpressions are given showing that this model reproduces the Born rule closely, but not\\nexactly. Thus most unmangled observers would remember having observed nearly Born\\nfrequencies, allowing us to reconcile the many worlds approach with the Born rule without\\ninvoking new fundamental physics or decision theory axioms.\\n\\nReferences\\n    [1] H.

Thus deviations from\\n                       exact decoherence can allow the Born rule to be derived in a many worlds approach\\n                       via world counting, using a ﬁnite number of worlds and no new fundamental physics.\\n\\n               Introduction\\n               Traditional quantum mechanics suﬀers from many ambiguities regarding quantum measure-\\n               ments. Many worlds approaches try to resolve these ambiguities by identifying measurements\\n               with decoherence events produced by standard linear quantum evolution [1, 2]. In such\\n               events, oﬀ-diagonal density matrix elements are often naturally and dramatically suppressed\\n               due to coupling with a large environment [3].\\n                    Unfortunately, the many worlds approach still suﬀers from the problem that, when there\\n               are a ﬁnite number of worlds, the straightforward way to calculate probabilities, i.e., counting\\n               the fraction of worlds with a given outcome, does not produce the standard Born probability\\n               rule [4, 5]. Some have tried to resolve this by adding new fundamental physics, such as\\n               non-linear dynamics [6], or an inﬁnity of worlds per quantum state which diverge via an\\n               unknown process [7]. Others propose new decision theory axioms saying we do not care\\n               about the number of worlds that see an outcome [8, 9].\\n                    A mangled worlds variation proposes to resolve the Born rule problem using only as-\\n               sumptions that are about the behavior of standard linear quantum evolution, assumptions\\n               that can in principle be checked by theoretical analysis of common quantum systems. The\\n               idea is that decoherence is never exact, and so while decoherence makes oﬀ-diagonal terms\\n               small relative to a large world, they can be large relative to a small enough world. This\\n               may plausibly mangle very small worlds, either destroying the observers in such worlds, or\\n               changing them into observers who remember events from large worlds [10].\\n                   ∗rhanson@gmu.edu http://hanson.gmu.edu 703-993-2326 FAX: 703-993-2323 MSN 1D3, Carow Hall, Fair-\\n               fax VA 22030\\n\\n                                                                         1', 'doc_id': 'fec0c160-bb07-4eea-be2e-897fd057d647', 'mimetype': 'text/plain', 'embedding': None, 'class_name': 'Document', 'extra_info': {'file_name': 'Drift-Diffusion in Mangled Worlds Quantum Mechanics'}, 'end_char_idx': None, 'relationships': {}, 'text_template': '{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', 'start_char_idx': None, 'metadata_template': '{key}: {value}', 'metadata_seperator': '\\n', 'excluded_llm_metadata_keys': [], 'excluded_embed_metadata_keys': []}, {'text': '                 This paper presents an explicit growth-drift-diﬀusion-absorption model of such a mangled\\nworlds scenario.

However, in the models that have been solved so far,\\ncoherence ϵ(t) typically eventually asymptotes to a small but non-zero level [3, 11, 12, 13].\\nworlds increases as eσ = e√wt. As discussed elsewhere [10], if ϵ(t) eventually falls slower\\n                                                                                           As we have seen in the previous section, the relative magnitude between any two random\\nthan this rate, then eventually the oﬀ diagonal terms ρsL and ρLs must greatly inﬂuence the\\nevolution of the smaller diagonal term ρss, even though these oﬀ diagonal terms have little\\ninﬂuence on and are mainly driven by the larger diagonal term ρLL. Thus the evolution\\nof smaller worlds is eventually driven by larger worlds, plausibly “mangling” those smaller\\nworlds, i.e., either destroying their observers or turning them into observers who remember\\noutcomes from a large world. Remaining observers would thus only remember the histories\\nof unmangled worlds.\\n    Let us conjecture that the mangling of worlds is a sudden, irreversible, and global process.\\nSpeciﬁcally, let us assume that there is a mangling region in world size, so that a world that\\nhas always remained larger than this region remains unmangled, and that a world that\\nwas once smaller than this region became suddenly and forevermore mangled. Let us also\\nconjecture that the relevant standard deviation σ is the result of many decoherence events,\\nmost of which are not counted in experiment tests. This suggests that the mangling region\\nis relatively narrow compared to σ. Finally, let us assume that since it is the measure of\\nsome worlds that mangles other worlds, this mangling region remains close to the median\\nmeasure ^ that would describe the distribution of all worlds were there no mangling.                                                                                               x\\n    If unmangled worlds evolve locally just as all worlds would were there no mangling,\\nand if initially all worlds are unmangled, then the distribution μ1(x, t) of unmangled worlds\\nshould satisfy equations 2 and 3, just as the distribution μ0(x, t) of all worlds under the no\\nmangling assumption.

To predict our existence in an ummangled\\nworld, the mangled worlds approach must predict that v > w.\\n\\n Born Rule Accuracy\\n How well does this diﬀusion process reproduce the Born rule? Let each distinct measurement\\n outcome k be associated with a set of Gk > 1 child worlds per parent world, each of which\\nis a factor Fk < 1 smaller than its parent. The Born rule says that the probability of an\\noutcome is given by FkGk. To see how closely does this mangled worlds approach conforms\\nwith the Born rule, let us calculate the number of unmangled worlds as associated with such\\nan experimental outcome.\\n                 Speciﬁcally, starting at time t = 0 let a single unmangled world of size y = ϵ (relative\\nto the mangling region at y = 0) evolve into a distribution μ(y, t1; ϵ) at time t1, where\\n1 ≪ wt1 ≫ ϵ. This is not intended to be the distribution of all worlds, but rather the\\ndistribution of all worlds consistent with the initial conditions of a given experiment to test\\nthe Born rule. It is the result of decoherence events both during and before the experiment,\\nevents that are not counted in the statistics of the experiment. Given what we know about\\nthe experiment, we do not know which of these worlds we are in, and so we must average\\nover these worlds when making experimental predictions.\\n                 At time t1, let each world with value y1 in μ(y, t1; ϵ) be split into G ≥ 1 worlds, each of\\nwhich is a factor F ≤ 1 smaller, so that it has the value y = y1 + ln(F ). Let each of these\\nworlds then evolve to produce more worlds over a longer time period t2 ≫ t1. For the Born\\n rule to apply exactly, the number of unmangled worlds in the ﬁnal distribution at time t2\\n should go as F G. (It would not contradict observations if the Born rule were violated soon\\n after t1, in worlds that were not mangled but were about to become mangled. What we\\n actually observe are long-existing historical records of experiments testing the Born rule.)\\n                 With a little help from Mathematica, the ﬁnal unmangled world count is found to be\\n               λ(F, G; t1, t2, ϵ) ≡ G∫ ∞W (t2; y)μ(y − ln(F ), t1; ϵ)dy\\n                                                                                                                                     0                                                  ⎛√\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   ⌈√wt2⎝⎜ .        ⌉⎜\\n                                                                                                  = F G erfc(− ln(F ))ϵeϵe(v−w)(t1 +t)⎛                                                                                                            √2wt1                      2  2\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                              − ewt/2erfc⎜\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                               2\\n                                                                                                                                                         4\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                    πwt2                                                    2\\nThe key thing to notice here is that when wt1 is large, the Born rule correction\\n\\n                                                                                                                                                                    5', 'doc_id': 'ed033f74-b0e9-437e-a53e-bb3a1d2f3693', 'mimetype': 'text/plain', 'embedding': None, 'class_name': 'Document', 'extra_info': {'file_name': 'Drift-Diffusion in Mangled Worlds Quantum Mechanics'}, 'end_char_idx': None, 'relationships': {}, 'text_template': '{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', 'start_char_idx': None, 'metadata_template': '{key}: {value}', 'metadata_seperator': '\\n', 'excluded_llm_metadata_keys': [], 'excluded_embed_metadata_keys': []}, {'text': '                                                                                                          γ(F, G) ≡ 1                                               λ(F, G; t, t2, ϵ)\\n                                                                                                                                                                                     λ(1, 1; t1, t2, ϵ) = erfc(− ln(F )).                                      1  √2wt1\\n                                                                                                                                                F G\\nchanges very slowly in the factor F . For example, when wt1 = 1010, it requires a factor of\\nF = e−105                                           < 10−43000 to get the relative number of worlds to be γ(F, G) ≈ 1/3. Thus this\\napproach is very nearly consistent with the Born rule, while leaving open the possibility of\\nsmall experimentally detectable deviations from the Born rule.\\n\\nConclusion\\nThis paper has presented an explicit growth-drift-diﬀusion-absorption model of a mangled\\nworlds scenario. Under this scenario, inexact decoherence results in larger worlds suddenly\\nand irreversibly mangling any worlds that reach a narrow region in world size. Closed form\\nexpressions are given showing that this model reproduces the Born rule closely, but not\\nexactly. Thus most unmangled observers would remember having observed nearly Born\\nfrequencies, allowing us to reconcile the many worlds approach with the Born rule without\\ninvoking new fundamental physics or decision theory axioms.\\n\\nReferences\\n    [1] H.

In this paper, we propose aquality-aware news recommendation method named QualityRec that can effectivelyimprove the quality of recommended news. In our approach, we first propose aneffective news quality evaluation method based on the distributions of users'reading dwell time on news.

We further train the recommendation model with an auxiliary newsquality prediction task to learn quality-aware recommendation model, and we adda recommendation quality regularization loss to encourage the model torecommend higher-quality news.

However, AI faces significant challenges in the Open Worldproblem, as it involves a new and unknown exploration journey. AI is notinherently proactive in exploration, and its challenge lies in not knowing howto approach and adapt to the unknown world. How do humans acquire knowledge ofthe unknown world. Humans identify new knowledge through intrinsic cognition.In the process of recognizing new colors, the cognitive cues are different fromknown color features and involve hue, saturation, brightness, and othercharacteristics. When AI encounters objects with different features in the newworld, it faces another challenge: where are the distinguishing featuresbetween influential features of new and old objects? AI often mistakes a newworld's brown bear for a known dog because it has not learned the differencesin feature distributions between knowledge systems.

However, AI faces significant challenges in the Open Worldproblem, as it involves a new and unknown exploration journey. AI is notinherently proactive in exploration, and its challenge lies in not knowing howto approach and adapt to the unknown world. How do humans acquire knowledge ofthe unknown world. Humans identify new knowledge through intrinsic cognition.In the process of recognizing new colors, the cognitive cues are different fromknown color features and involve hue, saturation, brightness, and othercharacteristics. When AI encounters objects with different features in the newworld, it faces another challenge: where are the distinguishing featuresbetween influential features of new and old objects? AI often mistakes a newworld's brown bear for a known dog because it has not learned the differencesin feature distributions between knowledge systems. This is because things inthe new and old worlds have different units and dimensions for their features.This paper proposes an open-world model and elemental feature system thatfocuses on fundamentally recognizing the distribution differences in objectivefeatures between the new and old worlds. The quantum tunneling effect oflearning ability in the new and old worlds is realized through the tractiveforce of meta-characteristic. The outstanding performance of the model systemin learning new knowledge (using pedestrian re-identification datasets as anexample) demonstrates that AI has acquired the ability to recognize the newworld with an accuracy of $96.71\\\\%$ at most and has gained the capability toexplore new knowledge, similar to humans.\", 'updated': '2023-11-22 11:55:41', 'entry_id': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13335v1', 'published': '2023-11-22 11:55:41', 'categories': ['cs.AI', 'cs.CV'], 'journal_ref': None, 'pdf_downloaded': None, 'primary_category': 'cs.AI'}]}\n",

In our approach, we first propose aneffective news quality evaluation method based on the distributions of users'reading dwell time on news.

We further train the recommendation model with an auxiliary newsquality prediction task to learn quality-aware recommendation model, and we adda recommendation quality regularization loss to encourage the model torecommend higher-quality news.
