    "## Task: Research Assistant with Web Search Integration\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This task is designed to conduct comprehensive research on multiple user-provided topics. It leverages web search capabilities to gather up-to-date information and generates relevant keywords for each topic, streamlining the research process through efficient tool integration and parallel processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **User Input**\n",
    "   - User provides a list of research topics\n",
    "   - Each topic is processed individually\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Web Search and Information Gathering**\n",
    "   - Utilizes BraveWeb to conduct searches for each topic\n",
    "   - Retrieves latest news and relevant information\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Intelligent Analysis**\n",
    "   - System analyzes search results (HTML snippets)\n",
    "   - Generates Wikipedia keywords related to each topic\n",
    "   - AI assistant identifies most relevant keywords based on search content\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Parallel Processing**\n",
    "   - Implements concurrent topic processing\n",
    "   - Enhances efficiency and reduces overall research time\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Multi-topic Research**: Handles multiple research topics simultaneously\n",
    "- **Up-to-date Information**: Utilizes web search to access current data\n",
    "- **Keyword Generation**: Provides relevant Wikipedia keywords for each topic\n",
    "- **AI-assisted Analysis**: Employs AI to identify and prioritize key information\n",
    "- **Efficient Processing**: Leverages parallel processing for faster results\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output\n",
    "\n",
    "- Comprehensive list of relevant Wikipedia keywords for each input topic\n",
    "- Curated, up-to-date information gathered from web searches\n",
    "\n",
    "This workflow provides a robust, efficient approach to in-depth topic exploration, combining the power of web search, AI analysis, and parallel processing.\n",
