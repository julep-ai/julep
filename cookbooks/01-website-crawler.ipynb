    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This task is a simple task that leverages the spider `integration` tool, and combines it with a prompt step to crawl a website for a given URL, and then create a summary of the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task Tools:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Spider Crawler**: An `integration` type tool that can crawl the web and extract data from a given URL.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task Input:\n",
    "\n",
    "**url**: The URL of the website to crawl.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "**output**: A dictionary that contains a `documents` key which contains the extracted data from the given URL. Check the output below for a detailed output schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Input**: The user provides a URL to crawl.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Spider Tool Integration**: The `spider_crawler` tool is called to crawl the web and extract data from the given URL.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Prompt Step**: The prompt step is used to create a summary of the results from the spider tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Output**: The final output is the summary of the results from the spider tool.\n",
