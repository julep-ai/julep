### Notes on authentication

# - agents-api runs under two modes:
#   + single-tenant: `SKIP_CHECK_DEVELOPER_HEADERS=True` and `AGENTS_API_KEY` is required
#     [user] --{Authorization: Bearer $api-key}--> [agents-api]
#   + multi-tenant:
#     `SKIP_CHECK_DEVELOPER_HEADERS=False` and requests must have a valid `X-Developer-Id` header
#     [user]
#       --{Authorization: Bearer $JWT}--> [gateway]
#       --{X-Developer-Id: $developer-id, Authorization: Bearer $internal-api-key}--> [agents-api]

# in single-tenant mode, developer id is assumed to be uuid '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000'
# and this is the default value of `X-Developer-Id` header in this case
# the `developers` table in cozo-db will have a row with `id` = '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000' and `name` = 'Default Developer'

# in multi-tenant mode, developer id is the id of the developer in the `developers` table in cozo-db
# and this id is expected in `X-Developer-Id` header
# the developer should have a valid JWT token issued by the gateway
# the JWT token is expected in `Authorization` header

# if the developer id is not found in the `developers` table in cozo-db, the request will be rejected

# in order for agents-api to work correctly in multi-tenant mode, the api assumes that:
# - the `gateway` is configured to forward `X-Developer-Id` header to agents-api

# and the gateway does that by expecting JWT token in `Authorization` header with the following claims:
# - `sub` claim is the developer ID
# - `email` claim is the developer email
# - `exp` claim is the expiration timestamp
# - `iat` claim is the issue timestamp
