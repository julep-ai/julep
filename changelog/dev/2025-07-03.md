## Julep AI Changelog - July 3, 2025

### Chat API Enhancements
- Added `auto_run_tools` property to ChatInput with default value of `false`
- Implemented automatic tool execution when `auto_run_tools=true` - tools are executed automatically and results fed back to the model
- Added new chat implementation that supports automatic tool calling workflow
- Separated legacy and new chat code for better maintainability

### API Architecture Improvements
- Refactored `execute_integration` and `execute_system` functions to accept explicit parameters instead of context objects
- Added context-free tool execution capability for use in chat endpoints
- Improved code organization with dedicated auto-tools and legacy directories
