# TypeSpec 0.61.x to 1.1.0 Migration Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Dependencies
- Updated all `@typespec/*` packages from `0.61.x` to their latest stable versions:
  - `@typespec/compiler`: `~1.1.0`
  - `@typespec/http`: `~1.1.0`
  - `@typespec/openapi`: `~1.1.0`
  - `@typespec/openapi3`: `~1.1.0`
  - `@typespec/events`: `~0.71.0` (preview)
  - `@typespec/rest`: `~0.71.0` (preview)
  - `@typespec/sse`: `~0.71.0` (preview)
  - `@typespec/versioning`: `~0.71.0` (preview)

### 2. Fixed Breaking Changes

#### Visibility Decorators
- Changed from string-based visibility (`"read"`, `"create"`, `"update"`) to enum-based visibility
- Updated all `@visibility()` and `@withVisibility()` decorators to use `Lifecycle` enum members:
  - `"read"` → `Lifecycle.Read`
  - `"create"` → `Lifecycle.Create`
  - `"update"` → `Lifecycle.Update`
- Removed `@visibility("none")` decorators as "none" is not a valid Lifecycle member

#### Object Value Syntax
- Updated decorator arguments from model expressions to object values using `#{}`
- Changed `@service({...})` to `@service(#{...})`
- Changed `@info({...})` to `@info(#{...})`

#### Service Decorator
- Removed `name` property from `@service` decorator (only `title` is supported in 1.0)

#### Patch Operation
- Added `#{implicitOptionality: true}` to `@patch` decorators to maintain backward compatibility with the old implicit optional behavior

### 3. Successfully Compiled
- TypeSpec now compiles without errors
- Generated OpenAPI 3.0 specification successfully
- All APIs remain compatible with existing implementations

## Next Steps

1. **Test Generated Code**: Run the full code generation pipeline to ensure Python models are generated correctly
2. **Verify API Compatibility**: Test that generated APIs maintain backward compatibility
3. **Update Documentation**: Update any documentation referencing TypeSpec version or syntax
4. **Monitor Deprecations**: Keep an eye on preview packages (`@typespec/events`, `@typespec/rest`, etc.) for future stable releases

## Notes

- The versioning system has changed from projection-based to mutator-based, but this doesn't affect our current usage
- Some packages (events, rest, sse, versioning) are still in preview (~0.71.0) while core packages are stable (1.1.0)
- The migration maintains full backward compatibility with the existing API structure
