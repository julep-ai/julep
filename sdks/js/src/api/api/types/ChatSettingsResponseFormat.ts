/**
 * An object specifying the format that the model must output.
 *
 * Setting to `{ "type": "json_object" }` enables JSON mode, which guarantees the message the model generates is valid JSON.
 *
 * **Important:** when using JSON mode, you **must** also instruct the model to produce JSON yourself via a system or user message. Without this, the model may generate an unending stream of whitespace until the generation reaches the token limit, resulting in a long-running and seemingly "stuck" request. Also note that the message content may be partially cut off if `finish_reason="length"`, which indicates the generation exceeded `max_tokens` or the conversation exceeded the max context length.
