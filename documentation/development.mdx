<Info>
  **Prerequisite**: Please install Node.js (version 19 or higher) before proceeding.
</Info>

Step 1. Install Mintlify on your OS:

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm i -g mintlify
```

```bash yarn
yarn global add mintlify
```

</CodeGroup>

Step 2. Go to the docs are located (where you can find `mint.json`) and run the following command:

```bash
mintlify dev
```

The documentation website is now available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Custom Ports

Mintlify uses port 3000 by default. You can use the `--port` flag to customize the port Mintlify runs on. For example, use this command to run in port 3333:

```bash
mintlify dev --port 3333
```

You will see an error like this if you try to run Mintlify in a port that's already taken:

```md
Error: listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::3000
```

## Mintlify Versions

Each CLI is linked to a specific version of Mintlify. Please update the CLI if your local website looks different than production.

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm i -g mintlify@latest
```

```bash yarn
yarn global upgrade mintlify
```

</CodeGroup>

## Deployment

## Execution Queries

The `get_execution.py` script has been updated to include a new field, `transition_count`, in the query results. This field provides the count of transitions associated with a specific execution. Developers working with execution queries should be aware of this addition as it affects how execution data is retrieved and interpreted.

### Key Changes:
- **transition_count**: This new field is included in the query results and represents the number of transitions for a given execution. It is part of the metadata returned by the query.

### Example Usage:
When querying execution data, the result will now include a `transition_count` within the metadata, which can be accessed as follows:

```python
result = get_execution(execution_id=execution.id, connection_pool=pool)
transition_count = result.metadata["transition_count"]
```

This change allows developers to easily track the number of transitions an execution has undergone, providing more insight into the execution's lifecycle.
