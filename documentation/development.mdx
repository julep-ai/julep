<Info>
  **Prerequisite**: Please install Node.js (version 19 or higher) before proceeding.
</Info>

Step 1. Install Mintlify on your OS:

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm i -g mintlify
```

```bash yarn
yarn global add mintlify
```

</CodeGroup>

Step 2. Go to the docs are located (where you can find `mint.json`) and run the following command:

```bash
mintlify dev
```

The documentation website is now available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Custom Ports

Mintlify uses port 3000 by default. You can use the `--port` flag to customize the port Mintlify runs on. For example, use this command to run in port 3333:

```bash
mintlify dev --port 3333
```

You will see an error like this if you try to run Mintlify in a port that's already taken:

```md
Error: listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::3000
```

## Mintlify Versions

Each CLI is linked to a specific version of Mintlify. Please update the CLI if your local website looks different than production.

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm i -g mintlify@latest
```

```bash yarn
yarn global upgrade mintlify
```

</CodeGroup>

## Deployment

<Tip>
  Unlimited editors available under the [Pro
  Plan](https://mintlify.com/pricing) and above.

## API Data Models and Structures

The API has undergone significant updates to its data models and structures. Below are the key changes:

- **Removal of `WebSearchCallOutputItem`**: This model has been removed from the API.

- **Introduction of New Models**:
  - `FunctionToolCall`: Represents a call to a function tool with attributes such as `id`, `type`, `call_id`, `name`, `arguments`, and `status`.
  - `ComputerToolCall`: Represents a call to a computer tool with attributes such as `id`, `type`, `call_id`, `action`, `pending_safety_checks`, and `status`.
  - `WebSearchToolCall`: Represents a call to a web search tool with attributes such as `id`, `type`, and `status`.

- **Updated `Annotation` Alias**:
  - The `Annotation` alias now includes `FileCitation`, `UrlCitation`, and `FilePath`.

These changes ensure that developers can effectively implement and interact with the updated API. For detailed information on each model and its attributes, please refer to the API reference documentation.
