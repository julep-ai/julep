<Info>
  **Prerequisite**: Please install Node.js (version 19 or higher) before proceeding.
</Info>

Step 1. Install Mintlify on your OS:

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm i -g mintlify
```

```bash yarn
yarn global add mintlify
```

</CodeGroup>

Step 2. Go to the docs are located (where you can find `mint.json`) and run the following command:

```bash
mintlify dev
```

The documentation website is now available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Custom Ports

Mintlify uses port 3000 by default. You can use the `--port` flag to customize the port Mintlify runs on. For example, use this command to run in port 3333:

```bash
mintlify dev --port 3333
```

You will see an error like this if you try to run Mintlify in a port that's already taken:

```md
Error: listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::3000
```

## Mintlify Versions

Each CLI is linked to a specific version of Mintlify. Please update the CLI if your local website looks different than production.

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm i -g mintlify@latest
```

```bash yarn
yarn global upgrade mintlify
```

</CodeGroup>

## Deployment

<Tip>
  Unlimited editors available under the [Pro
  Plan](https://mintlify.com/pricing) and above.
</Tip>

You should see the following if the deploy successfully went through:

## Entelligence Chat Integration

The `entelligence-chat.js` script allows you to integrate the Entelligence Chat widget into your documentation site. Follow these steps to set it up:

1. **Include the Script**: Ensure the `entelligence-chat.js` script is included in your project. This script will automatically initialize the chat widget when the page loads.

2. **Script Initialization**: The script will look for an element with the ID `entelligence-chat-root` to attach the chat widget. Ensure this element is present in your HTML.

3. **Styling**: The script fetches styles from an external CSS file and applies them to the chat widget using a shadow DOM. No additional styling is required unless customization is needed.

4. **Configuration**: The script initializes the chat with the following configuration:
   - `repoName`: "julep"
   - `organization`: "julep-ai"
   - `apiKey`: "-QPa1vq4X-2-KwLus5GxhDBE71g5BdXKwZs2M3iPh8U"
   - `theme`: 'dark'
   - `companyName`: "Julep AI"

Ensure these values are correct for your use case.
