## Development Process

### Build, Lint, and Test Commands

For Python:

- **Lint**: `poe lint` or `ruff check`
- **Format**: `poe format` or `ruff format`
- **Typecheck**: `poe typecheck` or `pytype --config pytype.toml`
- **Test**: `poe test` or use `pytest tests/test_file.py::test_function`
- **SQL Validation**: `poe validate-sql`
- **Full Check**: `poe check` (includes lint, format, validate-sql, typecheck)

For Node:

- **Build**: `yarn build` or `./scripts/build`
- **Test**: `yarn test` or `./scripts/test`
- **Lint**: `yarn lint` or `./scripts/lint`
- **Format**: `yarn format` or `./scripts/format`

### Code Style Guidelines

- **Python**: Use snake_case for variables/functions, PascalCase for classes. Strict typing with annotations; use pydantic for data validation. Max line length 96 characters, 4 spaces indentation.
- **TypeScript**: camelCase for variables/functions, PascalCase for classes.
- **Import Order**: Standard library, third-party, local packages.
- **Exceptions**: Define custom exceptions in dedicated exceptions.py modules.
- **Async/Await**: Use async/await patterns consistently where applicable.
- **Architecture**: Follow microservice architecture patterns within Docker Compose.
- **Documentation**: Add docstrings to functions/classes for better documentation.

## Local Development

Step 1. Install Mintlify on your OS:

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm i -g mintlify
```

```bash yarn
yarn global add mintlify
```

</CodeGroup>

Step 2. Navigate to the directory where the docs are located (where you can find `mint.json`) and run the following command:

```bash
mintlify dev
```

The documentation website is now available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Custom Ports

Mintlify uses port 3000 by default. You can use the `--port` flag to customize the port Mintlify runs on. For example, use this command to run on port 3333:

```bash
mintlify dev --port 3333
```

You will see an error like this if you try to run Mintlify on a port that's already taken:

```md
Error: listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::3000
```

## Mintlify Versions

Each CLI is linked to a specific version of Mintlify. Please update the CLI if your local website looks different than production.

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm i -g mintlify@latest
```

```bash yarn
yarn global upgrade mintlify
```

</CodeGroup>

## Deployment

<Tip>
  Unlimited editors available under the [Pro Plan](https://mintlify.com/pricing) and above.
</Tip>

You should see the following if the deploy successfully went through:

  <img src="/images/checks-passed.png" style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }} />

## Troubleshooting

Here's how to solve some common problems when working with the CLI.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Mintlify is not loading">
    Update to Node v18. Run `mintlify install` and try again.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="No such file or directory on Windows">
    Go to the `C:/Users/Username/.mintlify/` directory and remove the `mint` folder. Then open the Git Bash in this location and run `git clone https://github.com/mintlify/mint.git`.

    Repeat step 3.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Getting an unknown error">
    Try navigating to the root of your device and delete the ~/.mintlify folder. Then run `mintlify dev` again.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
