<Info>
  **Prerequisite**: Please install Node.js (version 19 or higher) before proceeding.
</Info>

Step 1. Install Mintlify on your OS:

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm i -g mintlify
```

```bash yarn
yarn global add mintlify
```

</CodeGroup>

Step 2. Go to the docs are located (where you can find `mint.json`) and run the following command:

```bash
mintlify dev
```

The documentation website is now available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Custom Ports

Mintlify uses port 3000 by default. You can use the `--port` flag to customize the port Mintlify runs on. For example, use this command to run in port 3333:

```bash
mintlify dev --port 3333
```

You will see an error like this if you try to run Mintlify in a port that's already taken:

```md
Error: listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::3000
```

## Mintlify Versions

Each CLI is linked to a specific version of Mintlify. Please update the CLI if your local website looks different than production.

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm i -g mintlify@latest
```

```bash yarn
yarn global upgrade mintlify
```

</CodeGroup>

## Deployment

<Tip>
  Unlimited editors available under the [Pro
  Plan](https://mintlify.com/pricing) and above.
</Tip>

You should see the following if the deploy successfully went through:

## Troubleshooting

Here's how to solve some common problems when working with the CLI.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Mintlify is not loading">
    Update to Node v18. Run `mintlify install` and try again.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="No such file or directory on Windows">
Go to the `C:/Users/Username/.mintlify/` directory and remove the `mint`
folder. Then Open the Git Bash in this location and run `git clone
https://github.com/mintlify/mint.git`.

Repeat step 3.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Getting an unknown error">
    Try navigating to the root of your device and delete the ~/.mintlify folder.
    Then run `mintlify dev` again.
  </Accordion>

## Unstructured Integration

### Overview

Welcome to the Unstructured.io integration guide for Julep! This integration allows you to extract structured information from a wide variety of document formats, enabling you to build workflows that leverage advanced document processing capabilities. Whether you're developing a document analysis system, creating a RAG pipeline, or need to convert unstructured documents into structured data, this guide will walk you through the setup and usage.

### Prerequisites

<Info type="info" title="API Key Required">
  To use the Unstructured.io integration, you need an API key. You can obtain this key by signing up at [Unstructured.io](https://unstructured.io/).
</Info>

### How to Use the Integration

To get started with the Unstructured.io integration, follow these steps to configure and create a task:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure Your API Key">
    Add your API key to the tools section of your task. This will allow Julep to authenticate requests to Unstructured.io on your behalf.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create Task Definition">
    Use the following YAML configuration to define your document parsing task:

    ```yaml Unstructured Example
    name: Unstructured Document Processing Task
    tools:
      - name: unstructured_processor
        type: integration
        integration:
          provider: unstructured
          setup:
            unstructured_api_key: ${UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY}
    main:
      - tool: unstructured_processor
        arguments:
          file: "${document_base64}"
          filename: "document.pdf"
          partition_params:
            key1: value1 # these are placeholders for the actual parameters
            key2: value2 # these are placeholders for the actual parameters
        result_var: "parsed_document"
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Run Task">
    Deploy your task by creating a new execution.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### YAML Explanation

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Basic Configuration">
    - **_name_**: A descriptive name for the task, in this case, "Unstructured Document Processing Task".
    - **_tools_**: This section lists the tools or integrations being used. Here, `unstructured_processor` is defined as an integration tool.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Tool Configuration">
    - **_type_**: Specifies the type of tool, which is `integration` in this context.
    - **_integration_**: Details the provider and setup for the integration.
      - **_provider_**: Indicates the service provider, which is `unstructured` for Unstructured.io.
      - **_setup_**: Contains configuration details
          - **_unstructured_api_key_**: (Required) The API key for your Unstructured.io account.
          - **_server_url_**: (Optional) Custom API endpoint URL if needed.
          - **_server_**: (Optional) Server name to use.
          - **_url_params_**: (Optional) Dictionary of parameters to template the server URL with.
          - **_timeout_ms_**: (Optional) Request timeout in milliseconds.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Execution Configuration">
    - **_main_**: Defines the main execution steps.
      - **_tool_**: Refers to the tool defined earlier (`unstructured_processor`).
      - **_arguments_**: Specifies the input parameters for the tool:
        - **_file_**: Base64 encoded file string.
        - **_filename_**: (Optional) The name of the file. Helpful for file type detection. In case no filename is provided, a random UUID will be generated.
        - **_partition_params_**: (Optional) Advanced parameters for document processing. To see the full list of parameters, please refer to the [Unstructured.io API documentation](https://docs.unstructured.io/api-reference/partition/api-parameters).
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Callout type="info" title="Additional Parameters">
  The different parameters available for the Unstructured.io integration can be found in the [Unstructured.io API documentation](https://docs.unstructured.io/api-reference/).
</Callout>

<Note>
  Remember to replace `${UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY}` with your actual API key or use environment variables. For base64 encoded files, ensure your file is properly encoded before passing it to the integration.
</Note>

<Note>
  Unstructured.io supports a wide range of file types including PDFs, Word documents, PowerPoint presentations, Excel spreadsheets, emails, HTML, images, and more. For a full list of supported file types, please refer to the [Unstructured.io documentation](https://docs.unstructured.io/getting-started/supported-files).
</Note>

### Conclusion

With the Unstructured.io integration, you can efficiently convert unstructured documents into structured data for analysis, search, and AI applications. This integration provides a powerful solution for document processing, enhancing your workflow's capabilities and enabling advanced RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipelines.
