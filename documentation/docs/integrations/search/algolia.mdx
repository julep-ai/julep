## Overview

Welcome to the Algolia integration guide for Julep! This integration allows you to perform powerful searches across your Algolia indices, enabling workflows that require fast, relevant, and typo-tolerant search capabilities. Whether you're building a site search, content discovery system, or personalized recommendation engine, this guide will help you set up and use Algolia with Julep.

## Prerequisites

<Info type="info" title="Algolia Account and API Keys Required">
  To use the Algolia integration, you need an Algolia account with an Application ID and API Key. You can sign up for an account at [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/users/sign_up) and obtain your API credentials from the Algolia dashboard.
</Info>

## How to Use the Integration

To get started with the Algolia integration, follow these steps to configure and create a task:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure Your API Credentials">
    Add your Algolia Application ID and API Key to the tools section of your task. This will allow Julep to authenticate requests to Algolia on your behalf.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create Task Definition">
    Use the following YAML configuration to define your search task:

    ```yaml Algolia Search Example
    name: Algolia Search Task
    tools:
      - name: algolia_search
        type: integration
        integration:
          provider: algolia
          method: search
          setup:
            algolia_application_id: "ALGOLIA_APPLICATION_ID"
            algolia_api_key: "ALGOLIA_API_KEY"
    main:
      - tool: algolia_search
        arguments:
          index_name: your_index_name # this is a placeholder for the actual index name
          query: searchquery # this is a placeholder for the actual search query
          hits_per_page: 10
          attributes_to_retrieve:
            key1: value1 # these are placeholders for the actual parameters
            key2: value2 # these are placeholders for the actual parameters
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

        - **_algolia_application_id_**: Your Algolia Application ID.
        - **_algolia_api_key_**: Your Algolia API Key (should be a search-only API key for security).
  </Accordion>

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Note>
  Remember to replace `"ALGOLIA_APPLICATION_ID"` and `"ALGOLIA_API_KEY"` with your actual Algolia credentials. For security, it's recommended to use search-only API keys with the minimal necessary permissions.
</Note>
