        type: integration
        integration:
          provider: arxiv
          method: search
    main:
      - tool: arxiv_search
        arguments:
          query: "machine learning"
          max_results: 10
          download_pdf: False
          sort_by: "relevance"
          sort_order: "descending"
    ```
  </Step>
