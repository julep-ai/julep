## Overview

Welcome to the Remote Browser integration guide for Julep! This integration allows you to manage browser sessions and perform various actions, enabling you to build workflows that require browser automation capabilities. 
Whether you're testing web applications or automating web tasks, this guide will walk you through the setup and usage.

## Prerequisites

<Info type="info" title="Setup Required">
  To use the Remote Browser integration, you need to configure a remote browser to connect to. The integration then uses Playwright for browser automation to interact with the that remote browser.
</Info>

## How to Use the Integration

To get started with the Remote Browser integration, follow these steps to configure and create a task:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure Remote Browser">
    Add your Remote Browser configuration (say Browserbase) to the tools section of your task. This will allow Julep to manage browser automation on your behalf to interact with the remote browser.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create Task Definition">
    Use the following YAML configuration to perform browser actions in your task definition:

    ```yaml Remote Browser Example
    name: Browser Automation Task
    tools:
      - name: browserbase_tool
        type: integration
        integration:
          provider: browserbase
          method: create_session
          setup:
            project_id: {browserbase_project_id}

      - name: browser_tool
        type: integration
        integration:
          provider: remote_browser
          method: perform_action
          setup:
            width: 1920
            height: 1080
    main:

      - tool: browserbase_tool
        method: create_session
        arguments:
          project_id: {browserbase_project_id}

      - evaluate:
          browser_session_id: $ _.id
          connect_url: $ _.connect_url

      - tool: browser_tool
        arguments:
          connect_url: $ _.connect_url
          action: "navigate"
          text: "https://www.google.com"
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>
