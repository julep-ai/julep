## How to Use the Integration

To get started with the Spider integration, follow these steps to configure and create a task:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure Your API Key">
    Add your API key to the tools section of your task. This will allow Julep to authenticate requests to Spider on your behalf.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create Task Definition">
    Use the following YAML configuration to define your web crawling task:

    ```yaml Spider Example
    name: Spider Task
    tools:
      - name: spider_tool
        type: integration
        integration:
          provider: spider
          method: crawl
          setup:
            spider_api_key: {spider_api_key}
    main:
      - tool: spider_tool
        method: crawl
        arguments:
          url: "https://example.com"
          params: # Optional parameters
            key1: value1 # this a placeholder for the actual parameters
          content_type: "application/json"
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>
