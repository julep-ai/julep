## How to Use the Integration

To get started with the Cloudinary integration, follow these steps to configure and create a task:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure Your API Key">
    Add your API key, API secret, and cloud name to the tools section of your task. This will allow Julep to authenticate requests to Cloudinary on your behalf.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create Task Definition">
    Use the following YAML configuration to define your media processing task:

    ```yaml Cloudinary Example
    name: Cloudinary Task
    tools:
      - name: cloudinary_tool
        type: integration
        integration:
          provider: cloudinary
          method: media_upload
          setup:
            cloudinary_cloud_name: {cloudinary_cloud_name}
            cloudinary_api_key: {cloudinary_api_key}
            cloudinary_api_secret: {cloudinary_api_secret}
            params: # Optional setup parameters
              key1: value1 # these are placeholders for the actual parameters
              key2: value2 # these are placeholders for the actual parameters
    main:
      - tool: cloudinary_tool
        arguments:
          file: "https://example.com/image.jpg"
          public_id: "my_image"
          upload_params: # Optional upload parameters
            param1: value1 # these are placeholders for the actual parameters
            param2: value2 # these are placeholders for the actual parameters
          return_base64: false
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>
