## Overview

Julep leverages LiteLLM to seamlessly connect you to a wide array of Language Models (LLMs). This integration offers incredible flexibility, allowing you to tap into models from various providers with a straightforward, unified interface.

<Info>
With our unified API, switching between different providers is a breeze, ensuring you maintain consistent functionality across the board.
</Info>

## Available Models

<Info>
While we provide API keys for quick testing and development, you'll need to use your own API keys when deploying to production. This ensures you have full control over your usage and billing.
</Info>

<Tip>
Looking for top-notch quality? Our curated selection of models delivers excellent outputs for all your use cases.

## Supported Parameters

Following are a list of different paramters that can be used to control the behavior of the models.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Core Parameters" icon="sliders" defaultOpen={true}>
    | Parameter | Range | Description |
    |-----------|--------|-------------|
    | temperature | 0.0 - 5.0 | Controls randomness in outputs. Higher values (e.g., 0.8) increase randomness, while lower values (e.g., 0.2) make output more focused and deterministic |
    | top_p | 0.0 - 1.0 | Alternative to temperature for nucleus sampling. Only tokens with cumulative probability < top_p are considered. We recommend adjusting either this or temperature, not both |
    | max_tokens | â‰¥ 1 | Maximum number of tokens to generate in the response |
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Penalty Parameters" icon="gauge" defaultOpen={true}>
    | Parameter | Range | Description |
    |-----------|--------|-------------|
    | frequency_penalty | -2.0 - 2.0 | Penalizes tokens based on their frequency in the text. Positive values decrease repetition |
    | presence_penalty | -2.0 - 2.0 | Penalizes tokens based on their presence in the text. Positive values decrease likelihood of repeating content |
    | repetition_penalty | 0.0 - 2.0 | Penalizes repetition (1.0 is neutral). Values > 1.0 reduce likelihood of repeating content |
    | length_penalty | 0.0 - 2.0 | Penalizes based on generation length (1.0 is neutral). Values > 1.0 penalize longer generations |
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Advanced Controls" icon="gear" defaultOpen={true}>
    | Parameter | Range | Description |
    |-----------|--------|-------------|
    | min_p | 0.0 - 1.0 | Minimum probability threshold compared to the highest token probability |
    | seed | integer | For deterministic generation. Set a specific seed for reproducible results |
    | stop | list[str] | Up to 4 sequences where generation should stop |
  </Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>
<Info>
Not all parameters are supported by every model. Please refer to the [LiteLLM documentation](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/completion/input) for more details.
</Info>

<Note>
  **Best Practices:**
  - Start with default values and adjust based on your needs
  - Use temperature (0.0 - 1.0) for most cases
  - Avoid setting multiple penalty parameters simultaneously
  - Test different combinations for optimal results
</Note>

<Warning>
  Setting extreme values for multiple parameters may lead to unexpected behavior or poor quality outputs.
</Warning>

## Usage Guidelines

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Consider Model Selection Criteria" icon="chart-line">
    <ul>
      <li>**1.** Your budget and cost constraints</li>
      <li>**2.** How fast you need responses</li>
      <li>**3.** The quality you're aiming for</li>
      <li>**4.** The context window size you require</li>
    </ul>
  </Card>

  <Card title="Follow Best Practices" icon="check">
    <ul>
      <li>**1.** Start with smaller models for development and testing</li>
      <li>**2.** Use larger context windows only when necessary</li>
      <li>**3.** Keep an eye on token usage to manage costs</li>
    </ul>
