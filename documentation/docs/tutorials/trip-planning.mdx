## Overview

The Tourist Plan task demonstrates how to:
- Execute Julep workflow-steps in parallel
- Integrate with external APIs ([Weather](/tools/available-integrations#weather) and [Brave Search](/tools/available-integrations#brave-search))
- Combine data from multiple sources
- Generate personalized itineraries using AI

## Task Structure

Let's break down the task into its core components:

### 1. Input Schema

First, we define what inputs our task expects:

```yaml

input_schema:
    type: object
    properties:
        locations:
            type: array
            items:
                type: string
```


This schema specifies that our task expects an array of location strings (e.g., `["New York", "London", "Paris"]`).

### 2. Tools Configuration

Next, we define the external tools our task will use:

```yaml
- name: weather
  type: integration
  integration:
    provider: weather
    setup:
      openweathermap_api_key: YOUR_OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY

- name: internet_search
  type: integration
  integration:
    provider: brave
    setup:
      api_key: YOUR_BRAVE_API_KEY
```

We're using two integrations:
- The `weather` integration to fetch current weather conditions
- The `brave` search integration to find tourist attractions

### 3. Main Workflow Steps

<Steps>

  <Step title="Get Weather Data">

    ```yaml
  - over: $ steps[0].input.locations
    map:
      tool: weather
      arguments:
        location: $ _
    ```

    <Accordion title="Understanding the use of the _ Variable in iteration steps">
      When used inside a `map` or a `foreach` step, the `_` variable is a reference to the current value in the iteration.

      For example:
      ```yaml
      - over: $ ["Paris", "London"]
        map:
          tool: weather
          arguments:
            location: $ _ # _ will be "Paris", then "London"
      ```
    </Accordion>


    This step:
    - Iterates over each location in the input array
    - Calls the weather API for each location
  </Step>

  <Step title="Search for Tourist Attractions">

    ```yaml
  - over: $ steps[0].input.locations
    map:
      tool: internet_search
      arguments:
        query: $ 'tourist attractions in ' + _
    ```


    This step:
    - Iterates over the locations again
    - Searches for tourist attractions in each location
    - Constructs a search query by concatenating "tourist attractions in " with the location
  </Step>

  <Step title="Combine Data">

    ```yaml
  - evaluate:
      zipped: |-
        $ list(
          zip(
            steps[0].input.locations,
            [output['result'] for output in steps[0].output],
            steps[1].output
          )
        )
    ```


    This step:
    - Combines the data from previous steps into tuples
    - Each tuple contains: (location, weather_data, attractions_data)
    - Uses Python's `zip` function to align the data

  </Step>

  <Step title="Generate Itineraries">

    ```yaml
  - over: $ _['zipped']
    parallelism: 3
    # Inside the map step, each `_` represents the current element in the list
    # which is a tuple of (location, weather, attractions)
    map:
      prompt:
      - role: system
        content: >-
          $ f'''You are {agent.name}. Your task is to create a detailed itinerary
          for visiting tourist attractions in some locations.
          The user will give you the following information for each location:

          - The location
          - The current weather condition
          - The top tourist attractions'''
      - role: user
        content: >-
          $ f'''Location: "{_[0]}"
          Weather: "{_[1]}"
          Attractions: "{_[2]}"'''
      unwrap: true
    ```


    This step:
    - Processes up to 3 locations in parallel
    - For each location tuple:
      - Sends a prompt to the AI model
      - Includes location, weather, and attraction data
      - Generates a personalized itinerary

  </Step>

  <Step title="Format Final Output">

    ```yaml
  - evaluate:
      final_plan: |-
        $ '\\n---------------\\n'.join(activity for activity in _)
    ```


    This step:
    - Combines all itineraries into a single output
    - Separates each itinerary with a divider

  </Step>

</Steps>
