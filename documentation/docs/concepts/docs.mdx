## Overview

Documents in Julep provide a way to store and retrieve information that can be used by agents. This section covers how to work with documents effectively.

## Components

Documents in Julep consist of several key components that enable efficient storage and retrieval of information.

- **Title**: The title component helps identify and organize documents.
- **Content**: The textual content of the document.
- **Embeddings** (automatically generated): The vector representations of text that enable semantic search capabilities. Generated using the `text-embedding-3-large` model from OpenAI.
- **Metadata**: Metadata provides additional context and filtering capabilities for documents.

### Docs Configuration Options

When creating a doc, the following attributes can be specified:

| **Field**  | **Type** | **Description**                                                           | **Default** |
|------------|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| `title`    | string   | The title of the document.                                                | Required    |
| `content`  | string   | The content of the document.                                              | Required    |
| `metadata` | object   | Additional metadata for the document, such as preferences or settings.    | `null`      |

## How to Use Docs

### Creating a Doc

Documents are attached to either an agent or a user. This is how you can create a doc using Julep's SDKs.

**Example:**

<CodeGroup>
    ```python Python
    # Creating a doc
    client.agents.docs.create(
        agent_id=agent.id,
        title="Old World",
        content="The medieval period, spanning roughly from the 5th to the late 15th century, was a time of significant transformation across Europe, Asia, and Africa. In Europe, the era was marked by the rise of feudalism, the power of the Catholic Church, and the cultural blossoming of the Renaissance towards its end. Asia witnessed the flourishing of the Silk Road, facilitating trade and cultural exchange, and the rise of powerful empires such as the Mongol Empire, which at its height, stretched from Europe to Asia. Meanwhile, Africa saw the growth of influential kingdoms and empires like Mali, known for its wealth and the legendary pilgrimage of Mansa Musa, and the spread of Islam across the continent, which played a crucial role in shaping its cultural and social landscapes.",
        metadata={"source": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medieval_period"},
    )
    ```

    ```javascript Node.js
    // Creating a doc
    const doc = await client.agents.docs.create({
        agent_id: "agent_id",
        title: "Old World",
        content: "The medieval period, spanning roughly from the 5th to the late 15th century, was a time of significant transformation across Europe, Asia, and Africa. In Europe, the era was marked by the rise of feudalism, the power of the Catholic Church, and the cultural blossoming of the Renaissance towards its end. Asia witnessed the flourishing of the Silk Road, facilitating trade and cultural exchange, and the rise of powerful empires such as the Mongol Empire, which at its height, stretched from Europe to Asia. Meanwhile, Africa saw the growth of influential kingdoms and empires like Mali, known for its wealth and the legendary pilgrimage of Mansa Musa, and the spread of Islam across the continent, which played a crucial role in shaping its cultural and social landscapes.",
        metadata: {"source": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medieval_period"},
    });
    ```
</CodeGroup>

<Info>
    To create a user doc, replace `client.agents.docs.create` with `client.users.docs.create`, and the `agent_id` argument with `user_id`.
</Info>

### Chunking

In Julep, documents are not automatically chunked. We recommend that developers handle chunking based on their specific use case requirements, as different applications may have unique needs for how documents should be divided. 

For those who need assistance with chunking, we provide a utility function `chunk_doc` that can be used directly in task steps. For implementation details, you can check the source code for this method in [this file](https://github.com/julep-ai/julep/blob/main/agents-api/agents_api/activities/utils.py).

### Search

#### Full Text Search

Our full-text search functionality leverages Timescale's powerful indexing to efficiently match user-provided keywords and phrases against document content, delivering relevant results even with variations in text. Key features include prefix and infix searching, morphology processing (stemming and lemmatization), fuzzy searching to handle typos, and exact result counts.

**Parameters:**

- **text** (`str`): The textual query to search within documents.
- **metadata_filter** (`object`, optional): Filters to apply based on document metadata.
- **lang** (`str`, default `'en-US'`): The language to use for full-text search processing.

**Example:**

<CodeGroup>
    ```python Python
    # Define the query
    text_query = "Medieval times in Europe"

    # Search for docs
    matched_docs = client.agents.docs.search(
        agent_id="agent_id",
        text=text_query,
        limit=10, # the maximum number of docs to return
    )

    print(matched_docs.model_dump())
    ```

    ```javascript Node.js
    // Define the query
    const text_query = "Medieval times in Europe";

    // Search for docs
    const matched_docs = await client.agents.docs.search({
        agent_id: "agent_id",
        text: text_query,
        limit: 10, // the maximum number of docs to return
    });

    console.log(matched_docs);
    ```
</CodeGroup>

#### Embedding Search

Our embedding search functionality leverages machine learning to convert search queries and documents into numerical vectors, enabling semantic matching based on vector similarity. It utilizes an embedding space where similar vectors indicate related content and employs algorithms like k-nearest neighbors (KNN) to retrieve the most relevant documents. Key features include context awareness, flexibility for natural language queries, multi-modal search across various content types, and effective handling of synonyms.

**Parameters:**

- **vector** (`List[float]`): The embedding vector representing the semantic meaning of the query.
- **alpha** (`float`, default `0.7`): The weight assigned to embedding-based results versus text-based results.
- **confidence** (`float`, default `0.5`): The confidence threshold for embedding similarity.
- **metadata_filter** (`object`, optional): Filters to apply based on document metadata.
- **k** (`int`, default `3`): The number of top results to return.

<CodeGroup>
    ```python Python
    # Define the vector query
    vector_query = client.docs.embed(text="Medieval times in Europe").vectors[0]

    # Search for docs
    matched_docs = client.agents.docs.search(
        agent_id="agent_id",
        vector=vector_query,
        limit=10, # the maximum number of docs to return
        confidence=-0.3, # confidence range is -1 to 1
    )

    print(matched_docs.model_dump())
    ```

    ```javascript Node.js
    // Define the vector query
    const embedding_result = client.docs.embed({ text: "Medieval times in Europe" });
    const vector_query = embedding_result.vectors[0];

    // Search for docs
    const matched_docs = await client.agents.docs.search({
        agent_id: "agent_id",
        vector: vector_query,
        limit: 10, // the maximum number of docs to return
        confidence: -0.3, // confidence range is -1 to 1
    });

    console.log(matched_docs);

#### Hybrid Search

Our hybrid search functionality combines the strengths of full-text search and embedding-based search to deliver highly relevant and accurate search results. By leveraging both keyword matching and semantic vector analysis, hybrid search ensures that queries are not only matched based on exact terms but also understood in context, providing more nuanced and precise results. This dual approach enhances search performance, improves result relevance, and accommodates a wider range of search queries.

**Parameters:**

- **text** (`str`): The textual query to search within documents.
- **vector** (`List[float]`): The embedding vector representing the semantic meaning of the query.
- **alpha** (`float`, default `0.7`): The weight assigned to embedding-based results versus text-based results.
- **confidence** (`float`, default `0.5`): The confidence threshold for embedding similarity.
- **metadata_filter** (`object`, optional): Filters to apply based on document metadata.
- **k** (`int`, default `3`): The number of top results to return.
- **lang** (`str`, default `'en-US'`): The language to use for full-text search processing.

**Example:**

<CodeGroup>
    ```python Python
    # Define the query
    text_query = "Medieval times in Europe"
    # Embed the query using the `docs.embed` method
    embedded_query = client.docs.embed(text=text_query).vectors[0]

    # Search for docs
    matched_docs = client.agents.docs.search(
        agent_id="agent_id",
        text=text_query,
        alpha=0.5, # the weight of the embedding query
        vector=embedded_query,
        confidence=-0.3, # confidence range is -1 to 1
    )

    print(matched_docs.model_dump())
    ```

    ```javascript Node.js
    // Define the query
    const text_query = "Medieval times in Europe";
    // Embed the query using the `docs.embed` method
    const embedding_result = await client.docs.embed({ text: text_query });
    const embedded_query = embedding_result.vectors[0];

    // Search for docs
    const matched_docs = await client.agents.docs.search({
        agent_id: "agent_id",
        text: text_query,
        vector: embedded_query,
        confidence: -0.3, // confidence range is -1 to 1
        alpha: 0.5, // the weight of the embedding query
    });

    ```
</Accordion>

## Filtering

While search is carried on based on the textual and/or semantic content of the documents, you can also filter the documents based on their metadata.

**Example:**

<CodeGroup>
    ```python Python
    # Filter docs based on metadata
    dev_client.agents.docs.list(
        agent_id="agent_id",
        metadata_filter={"source": "wikipedia"},
    )
    ```
</CodeGroup>

## Relationship to Other Concepts

### Sessions

Sessions have access to search, retrieve and reference agents and users documents inside chat conversations. Read more about it [here](/docs/concepts/sessions#documents).

### Tasks

By leveraging [System Tools](/docs/concepts/tools#system-tools), Julep [Tasks](/docs/concepts/tasks) have the ability to create, search, filter and read documents.

**Example:**

<CodeGroup>
    ```yaml
    input_schema:
      type: object
      properties:
        user_id:
          type: string
          description: The id of the user to list documents for

    tools:
    - name: "list_user_docs"
      description: "List all documents for the current user"
      type: "system"
      system:
        resource: user
        subresource: doc
        operation: list
    
    main:
    # Step that lists all documents for the current user
    - tool: "list_user_docs"
      arguments:
        user_id: $ _.user_id

    # Step that evaluates the textual contents of all documents for the current user
    - evaluate:
        all_user_docs_contents: $ [doc.content for doc in _.items]
    ```
