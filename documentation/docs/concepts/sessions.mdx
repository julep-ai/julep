## Overview

Sessions in Julep are the backbone of stateful interactions between users and agents. They maintain the context and history of conversations, enabling personalized and coherent interactions over extended periods. Whether it's handling ongoing customer support inquiries or having a conversation with a user, sessions ensure that the agent retains necessary information to provide meaningful responses.

## Components

Sessions are comprised of several key components that work together to manage state and context:

- **Session ID**: A unique identifier (`uuid7`) for each session.
- **User**: The individual or entity interacting with the agent, represented by its id.
- **Agent**: The AI entity interacting with the user within the session, represented by its id.
- **History**: The history of the conversation, which the agent uses to generate relevant responses.
- **System Template**: A specific system prompt template that sets the background for this session.
- **Situation**: A description of the current situation for the session.
- **Metadata**: Additional data associated with the session, such as user preferences, session preferences, and other relevant information.

### Session Configuration Options

When creating a session, you can leverage the following configuration options to tailor the experience:

| Option               | Type                                     | Description                                                                                       | Default        |

| `situation`          | str \| None                              | Description of the current situation for the session                                              | `None`         |
| `system_template`    | str \| None                              | A specific system prompt template that sets the background for this session                        | `None`         |
| `render_templates`   | StrictBool                               | Whether to render system and assistant messages as Jinja templates                                 | `True`         |
| `token_budget`       | int \| None                              | Threshold value for the adaptive context functionality                                           | `None`         |
| `auto_run_tools`     | StrictBool                               | Whether to auto-run tools and send the tool results to the model when available                   | `False`          |
| `forward_tool_calls` | StrictBool                               | Whether to forward tool calls directly to the model                                               | `False`          |
| `recall_options`     | RecallOptions \| None                    | Options for recalling context or certain data during the session                                  | `None`         |

### Recall Options

When configuring a session, you can specify recall options to control how context or certain data is recalled during the session. Below are the available options:

| Option               | Type                                     | Description                                                                                       | Default        |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|
| `mode`               | `hybrid` \| `vector` \| `text`           | The mode to use for the search.                                                                   | `vector`       |
| `num_search_messages`| integer                                  | The number of search messages to use for the search.                                              | `4`            |
| `max_query_length`   | integer                                  | The maximum query length to use for the search.                                                   | `1000`         |
| `alpha`              | float (0.0 - 1.0)                        | The weight to apply to BM25 vs Vector search results. 0 => pure BM25; 1 => pure vector.           | `0.7`            |
| `confidence`         | float (-1.0 - 1.0)                       | The confidence cutoff level.                                                                      | `0.6`            |
| `limit`              | integer (1 - 100)                        | The limit of documents to return.                                                                 | `10`             |
| `lang`               | `en-US`                                  | The language to be used for text-only search. Support for other languages coming soon.            | `en-US`        |
| `metadata_filter`    | object                                   | Metadata filter to apply to the search.                                                           | `{}`           |
| `mmr_strength`       | float (0.0 - 1.0)                        | MMR Strength (mmr_strength = 1 - mmr_lambda).                                                     | `0`            |

<Note>
- `recall_options` are utilized only when explicitly set; otherwise, they default to `None`. 
- Not every option within `recall_options` is applicable across all search modes. 
- Specifically, the `text` mode does not support `mmr_strength`, `alpha`, and `confidence`. 
- Additionally, the `vector` mode does not support `alpha`. 
- However, the parameters `num_search_messages`, `max_query_length`, `limit`, and `metadata_filter` are universally applicable to all modes.
</Note>

### System Template

<Info>
The **System Template** is a specific system prompt written as a Jinja template that sets the foundational context and instructions for the agent within a session. It defines the background, directives, and any relevant information that the agent should consider when interacting with the user. For more details on Jinja templates, refer to the [Jinja documentation](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/).
<Accordion title="Default System Template" icon="template">
```python
{%- if agent.name -%}
You are {{agent.name}}.{{" "}}
{%- endif -%}

{%- if agent.about -%}
About you: {{agent.about}}.{{" "}}
{%- endif -%}

{%- if user -%}
You are talking to a user
  {%- if user.name -%}{{" "}} and their name is {{user.name}}
    {%- if user.about -%}. About the user: {{user.about}}.{%- else -%}.{%- endif -%}

## How to Use Sessions

Sessions are integral to maintaining a continuous and coherent interaction between users and agents. Here's how to create and manage sessions using Julep's SDKs.

### Creating a Session

Here are examples of how to create a session using the SDKs:

<CodeGroup>
    ```python Python
    client = Julep(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")
    session = client.sessions.create(
        agent="agent_id",
        user="user_id",
        context_overflow="adaptive",
    )
    ```

    ```javascript Node.js
    const client = new Julep({ apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY' });
    const session = await client.sessions.create({
        agent_id: "agent_id",
        user_id: "user_id",
        context_overflow: "adaptive",
    });
    ```
</CodeGroup>

<Tip>
    Check out the [API reference](/api-reference/sessions) or SDK reference ([Python](/sdks/python/reference#sessions) or [JavaScript](/sdks/nodejs/reference#sessions)) for more details on different operations you can perform on sessions.
</Tip>

### Chatting in a Session

Once a session is created, you can engage in a conversation by sending messages to the agent within that session.

<CodeGroup>
    ```python Python
    client = Julep(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")
    response = client.sessions.chat(
        session_id="SESSION_ID",
        messages=[
            {
                "role": "user", # or "system"
                "content": "YOUR_MESSAGE"
            }
        ]
    )
    print("Agent's response:", response.choices[0].message.content)
    ```

    ```javascript Node.js
    const client = new Julep({ apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY' });
    const response = await client.sessions.chat({
        session_id: "SESSION_ID",
        messages: [
            {
                role: "user",
                content: "YOUR_MESSAGE"
            }
        ]
    });
    console.log("Agent:", response.choices[0].message.content);
    ```
</CodeGroup>


## Relationship to Other Concepts

This section will help you understand how sessions relate to other concepts in Julep.

### Agents

Agents operate within sessions to provide personalized and context-aware interactions. While an agent defines the behavior and capabilities, a session maintains the state and context of interactions between the agent and the user. In other words, the history of a conversation is tied to a session, rather than an agent.

Example:

```python
agent = client.agents.create(
    name="David",
    about="A news reporter",
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    instructions=["Keep your responses concise and to the point.", "If you don't know the answer, say 'I don't know'"],
    metadata={"channel": "FOX News"},
)

session1 = client.sessions.create(agent=agent.id, user="user_id", situation="The user is interested in the latest news about the stock market.")
session2 = client.sessions.create(agent=agent.id, user="user_id", situation="The user is interested in political news in the United States.")
```

<Info>
In this example, the agent David is used in two different sessions, each with a different situation. The agent's behavior and responses are tailored to the specific situation of each session, and the history of messages in `session1` and `session2` are separate.
</Info>

### Users

When a user (or more) is added to a session, the session will be able to access information about the user such as `name`, and `about` in order to personalize the interaction. Check out the `system_template` to see how the user's info is being accessed.

This is how you can create a user and associate it with a session:

<CodeGroup>
    ```python Python
    client = Julep(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")
    user = client.users.create(name="John Doe", about="A 21 year old man who is a student at MIT.")
    agent = client.agents.create(name="Mark Lee", about="A 49 year old man who is a retired software engineer.")
    session = client.sessions.create(agent_id=agent.id, user_id=user.id)
    ```

    ```javascript Node.js
    const client = new Julep({ apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY' });
    const user = await client.users.create({
        name: "John Doe",
        about: "A 21 year old man who is a student at MIT."
    });
    const agent = await client.agents.create({
        name: "Mark Lee",
        about: "A 49 year old man who is a retired software engineer."
    });
    const session = await client.sessions.create({
        agent_id: agent.id,
        user_id: user.id
    });
    ```
</CodeGroup>

<Info>
In this example, the user John Doe is associated with the agent Mark Lee in the session. The session will use the user's information to personalize the interaction, such as using the user's name in the system prompt.
</Info>

### Tools

Sessions have the ability to use [Tools](/docs/concepts/tools). If an agent has a tool, and the LLM decides to use it, the tool will be run and the result will be automatically sent to the LLM for further processing.

Example:

If the agent that's associated with the session has a tool called `fetch_weather`, and the LLM decides to use it, the tool will be run and the result will be automatically sent to the LLM for further processing.

<CodeGroup>
    ```python Python
    response = client.sessions.chat(
        session_id="session_id",
        messages=[
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": "What is the weather in San Francisco?"
            }
        ],
        auto_run_tools=True
    )

    print("Agent's response:", response.choices[0].message.content)
    # Agent's response: The weather in San Francisco is 70 degrees and it's sunny. Humidity is 50%, and the wind speed is around 10 mph.
    ```

    ```javascript Node.js
    const response = await client.sessions.chat({
        session_id: "session_id",
        messages: [
            {
                role: "user",
                content: "What is the weather in San Francisco?"
            }
        ],
        auto_run_tools=True
    });
    console.log("Agent:", response.choices[0].message.content);
    // Agent's response: The weather in San Francisco is 70 degrees and it's sunny. Humidity is 50%, and the wind speed is around 10 mph.
    ```
</CodeGroup>

### Documents

When chatting in a session, the session can automatically search for documents that are associated with any of the agents and/or users that participate in the session. You can control whether the session should search for documents when chatting using the `recall` option of the `chat` method, which is set to `True` by default. You can also set the session's `recall_options` when creating the session to control how the session should search for documents.

<CodeGroup>
    ```python Python
    # Create a session with custom recall options
    client.sessions.create(
        agent=agent.id,
        user=user.id,
        recall=True,
        recall_options={
            "mode": "vector", # or "hybrid", "text"
            "num_search_messages": 4, # number of messages to search for documents
            "max_query_length": 1000, # maximum query length
            "alpha": 0.7, # weight to apply to BM25 vs Vector search results (ranges from 0 to 1)
            "confidence": 0.6, # confidence cutoff level (ranges from -1 to 1)
            "limit": 10, # limit of documents to return
            "lang": "en-US", # language to be used for text-only search
            "metadata_filter": {}, # metadata filter to apply to the search
            "mmr_strength": 0, # MMR Strength (ranges from 0 to 1)
        }
    )

    # Chat in the session
    response = client.sessions.chat(
        session_id=session.id,
        messages=[
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": "Tell me about Julep"
            }
        ],
        recall=True
    )
    print("Agent's response:", response.choices[0].message.content)
    print("Searched Documents:", response.docs)
    ```

    ```javascript Node.js
    client.sessions.create({
        agent: agent.id,
        user: user.id,
        recall: true,
        recall_options: {
            mode: "vector", // or "hybrid", "text"
            num_search_messages: 4, // number of messages to search for documents
            max_query_length: 1000, // maximum query length
            alpha: 0.7, // weight to apply to BM25 vs Vector search results (ranges from 0 to 1)
            confidence: 0.6, // confidence cutoff level (ranges from -1 to 1)
            limit: 10, // limit of documents to return
            lang: "en-US", // language to be used for text-only search
            metadata_filter: {}, // metadata filter to apply to the search
            mmr_strength: 0, // MMR Strength (ranges from 0 to 1)
        }
    });

    // Chat in the session
    const response = await client.sessions.chat({
        session_id: session.id,
        messages: [
            {
                role: "user",
                content: "Tell me about Julep"
            }
        ],
        recall: true
    });
    ```
</CodeGroup>

<Info>
    When running the above code with an agent that has documents about Julep, the session will search for documents that are relevant to the conversation and return them in the `response.docs` field.
