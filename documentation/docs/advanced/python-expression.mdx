## Overview

Julep tasks support Python expressions for dynamic value computation and data manipulation. This guide explains how to use them effectively.

## The Special `_` Variable

The underscore `_` is a special variable that serves three different purposes depending on where it's used:

1. **First Step Input**: In the first step of a task, `_` contains the execution input:
```yaml
# If task is executed with input `{"topic": "AI"}`
- evaluate:
    topic: $ _.topic  # Accesses the input "AI"
```

2. **Previous Step Output**: In any subsequent step, `_` contains the output from the previous step:
```yaml
- evaluate:
    results: $ _.split('\n')  # Splits previous step's output into lines
```

3. **Iterator Value**: In `foreach` and `map` steps, `_` represents the current item being iterated.
```yaml
# If the task is executed with input `{"questions": ["What is AI?", "What is Julep?"]}`
- foreach:
    in: $ _.questions
    do:
      - wait_for_input:
          info:
            "message": $ _  # _ is each question
```

## The Special `$` Variable

The `$` variable is used to differentiate between a Python expression and a string. When using the `$` variable, the expression is evaluated as a Python expression.

```yaml
- evaluate:
    topic: $ _.topic  # Accesses the input "AI"
```

```yaml
- prompt:
    - role: user
      content: |-
        f'''
        Please answer the following question:
        {_.question} 
        '''
```
<Note>
To learn more about how to use the `$` variable, please refer to the [New Syntax](/docs/advanced/new-syntax) section.
</Note>

## Where Python Expressions Are Used

Python expressions can be used in various task steps. For a complete list of step types and their syntax, refer to the [Step Types table in the README](/docs/advanced/types-of-task-types).

Common places include:
- `evaluate` steps
- Tool `arguments`
- `if` conditions
- `foreach` and `map` iterations

## Available Functions and Libraries

The following Python functions and libraries are available for use in expressions:

### Basic Python Builtins
- `abs`, `all`, `any`, `bool`, `dict`, `enumerate`
- `float`, `int`, `len`, `list`, `map`, `max`, `min`
- `round`, `set`, `str`, `sum`, `tuple`, `zip`, `reduce`

### Safe Versions of Functions
- `range`: `def safe_range(*args)`
  
  Safely creates a range object with size limits (max 1,000,000 elements).

- `load_json`: `def safe_json_loads(s: str) -> Any` (Deprecated in favor of `json.loads`)
  
  Safely parses a JSON string with size limits.

- `load_yaml`: `def safe_yaml_load(s: str) -> Any` (Deprecated in favor of `yaml.safe_load`)
  
  Safely parses a YAML string with size limits.

- `dump_json`: `def dump_json(obj: Any, *, **kwargs) -> str` (Deprecated in favor of `json.dumps`)
  
  Safely serializes an object to a JSON string.

- `dump_yaml`: `def dump_yaml(obj: Any, **kwargs) -> str` (Deprecated in favor of `yaml.dump`)
  
  Safely serializes an object to a YAML string.

- `extract_json`: `def safe_extract_json(string: str) -> Any`
  
  Safely extracts and parses JSON from text.

### Regex and NLP Functions
- `search_regex`: `def search_regex(pattern: str, string: str) -> Optional[re2.Match]`
  
  Searches for a regex pattern in a string.

- `match_regex`: `def match_regex(pattern: str, string: str) -> bool`
  
  Checks if a regex pattern matches a string.

- `chunk_doc`: `def chunk_doc(string: str) -> list[str]`
  
  Chunks a string into sentences.

- `nlp` pipelines.

Example using these functions in an evaluate step:
```yaml
- evaluate:
    # Parse JSON string with size limit of 1MB
    data: $ json.loads(_.json_string)
    
    # Parse YAML string with size limit of 1MB
    config: $ yaml.safe_load(_.yaml_string)
    
    # Extract JSON from text that might contain markdown code blocks
    extracted_content: $ extract_json('Here is some JSON: ```json\n{"key": "value"}\n```')
```

### CSV Functions
- `reader`: `def reader(data: str, dialect="excel", delimiter: str = ",", quotechar: str | None = '"', escapechar: str | None = None, doublequote: bool = True, skipinitialspace: bool = False, lineterminator: str = "\r\n", quoting=0, strict: bool = False) -> csv._reader`

  Creates a CSV reader.

- `writer`: `def writer(data: str, dialect="excel", delimiter: str = ",", quotechar: str | None = '"', escapechar: str | None = None, doublequote: bool = True, skipinitialspace: bool = False, lineterminator: str = "\r\n", quoting=0, strict: bool = False) -> csv._writer`

  Creates a CSV writer.

- `DictReader`: `class DictReader(data: str, fieldnames=None, restkey=None, restval=None, dialect="excel", *args, **kwds)`

  Create an object that operates like a regular reader but maps the information in each row to a dict.

- `DictWriter`: `class DictWriter(data: str, fieldnames, restval="", extrasaction="raise", dialect="excel", *args, **kwds)`

  Create an object which operates like a regular writer but maps dictionaries onto output rows.

- `register_dialect`: `def register_dialect(name: str, dialect: type[Dialect] = ..., *, delimiter: str = ",", quotechar: str | None = '"', escapechar: str | None = None, doublequote: bool = True, skipinitialspace: bool = False, lineterminator: str = "\r\n", quoting: _QuotingType = 0, strict: bool = False) -> csv._reader`

  Associate dialect with name.

- `unregister_dialect`: `def unregister_dialect(name: str) -> None`

  Delete the dialect associated with name from the dialect registry.

- `get_dialect`: `def get_dialect(name: str) -> Dialect`

  Return the dialect associated with name.

- `list_dialects`: `def list_dialects() -> list[str]`

  Return the names of all registered dialects.

- `field_size_limit`: `def field_size_limit(new_limit: int = ...) -> int`

  Returns the current maximum field size allowed by the parser.

- `Dialect`: `class Dialect()`

  The Dialect class is a container class whose attributes contain information for how to handle doublequotes, whitespace, delimiters, etc.

- `excel`: `class excel()`

  The excel class defines the usual properties of an Excel-generated CSV file.

- `excel_tab`: `class excel_tab()`

  The excel_tab class defines the usual properties of an Excel-generated TAB-delimited file.

- `unix_dialect`: `class unix_dialect()`

  The unix_dialect class defines the usual properties of a CSV file generated on UNIX systems, i.e. using '\n' as line terminator and quoting all fields.

- `Sniffer`: `class Sniffer`

  The Sniffer class is used to deduce the format of a CSV file.

- `QUOTE_ALL` - Instructs writer objects to quote all fields.

- `QUOTE_MINIMAL` - Instructs writer objects to only quote those fields which contain special characters such as delimiter, quotechar or any of the characters in lineterminator.

- `QUOTE_NONNUMERIC` - Instructs writer objects to quote all non-numeric fields. Instructs reader objects to convert all non-quoted fields to type float.

- `QUOTE_NONE` - Instructs writer objects to never quote fields.

- `QUOTE_NOTNULL` - Instructs writer objects to quote all fields which are not None.

- `QUOTE_STRINGS` - Instructs writer objects to always place quotes around fields which are strings.

- `Error`: `class Error()`

  Raised by any of the functions when an error is detected.

This module tries to mimic `csv` module from the standard Python library. You can find additional information [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html)

## Example Usage

```yaml
name: Data Processing Task

main:
  # Using _ as input
  - evaluate:
      csv_data: $ [row for row in csv.reader("a,b,c\n1,2,3")]
```

### Standard Library Modules

- `json`: JSON operations
- `yaml`: YAML operations
- `string`: String constants and operations
- `datetime`: Date and time operations
- `math`: Mathematical functions
- `statistics`: Statistical operations
- `base64`: Base64 encoding/decoding
- `urllib.parse`: URL parsing operations

For the complete list of available functions and their safe implementations, refer to the [utils.py](https://github.com/julep-ai/julep/blob/main/agents-api/agents_api/activities/utils.py) file in the source code.

## Example Usage

Here's a practical example combining different aspects of Python expressions:

```yaml
name: Data Processing Task

main:
  # Using _ as input
  - evaluate:
      topics: $ _.topics  # Access input topics

  # Using _ as previous output
  - evaluate:
      filtered_topics: $ [t for t in _.topics if len(t) > 3]

  # Using _ in foreach
  - foreach:
      in: $ _.filtered_topics
      do:
        - tool: web_search
          arguments:
            query: $ 'Latest news about ' + _ # _ is each topic
```

## Security

All Python expressions are executed in a sandboxed environment with:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Function Limits" icon="function">
    <p>Limited available functions to prevent unsafe operations</p>
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="String Limits" icon="text-size">
    <p>Maximum string length restrictions to prevent memory issues</p>
  </Card>

  <Card title="Collection Limits" icon="layer-group">
    <p>Collection size limits to prevent resource exhaustion</p>
  </Card>

  <Card title="Time Limits" icon="clock">
    <p>Execution time limits to prevent infinite loops</p>
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

This ensures safe execution while providing necessary functionality for task workflows.
