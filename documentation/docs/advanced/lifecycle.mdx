## Overview

Understanding the lifecycle of a Julep task is crucial for building effective workflows. 
Let's explore this through the lens of a [Trip Plan task](/docs/tutorials/trip-planning) - a practical example that showcases key aspects of task execution.

The Trip Plan task is an ideal example because it demonstrates:
1. Parallel execution of workflow steps
2. Integration with multiple external APIs:
   - [Weather API](/docs/integrations/communication_data/weather) for current conditions
   - [Brave Search API](/docs/integrations/search_research/brave-search) for attractions
3. Data aggregation from various sources
4. AI-powered personalization of results

Below is a visual representation of how this task flows through Julep's execution lifecycle:

Let's examine each phase of the execution lifecycle using this task as our guide.

  This is a simplified representation of the execution lifecycle. In practice, Julep handles many more details and edge cases to ensure robust and efficient task execution.

<Note>
  Out here in this section, we will be focusing on the main workflow steps of the Trip Plan task and how these steps are executed in Julep.
</Note>

### 1. Input Schema

First, we define what inputs our task expects:

```yaml

input_schema:
    type: object
    properties:
        locations:
            type: array
            items:
                type: string
```


This schema specifies that our task expects an array of location strings (e.g., `["New York", "London", "Paris"]`).

### 2. Tools Configuration

Next, we define the external tools our task will use:

```yaml
- name: weather
  type: integration
  integration:
    provider: weather
    setup:
      openweathermap_api_key: {openweathermap_api_key}

- name: internet_search
  type: integration
  integration:
    provider: brave
    setup:
      api_key: {brave_api_key}
```

We're using two integrations:
- The `weather` integration to fetch current weather conditions
- The `brave` search integration to find tourist attractions

### 3. Main Workflow Steps

#### Step 1: Fetch Weather Data

```yaml
- over: inputs[0].locations
  map:
    tool: weather
    arguments:
      location: _
```

This step:
- Iterates over each location in the input array
- Calls the weather API for each location
- The `_` represents the current location in the iteration

#### Step 2: Search for Tourist Attractions

```yaml
- over: inputs[0].locations
  map:
    tool: internet_search
    arguments:
      query: "'tourist attractions in ' + _"
```


This step:
- Iterates over the locations again
- Searches for tourist attractions in each location
- Constructs a search query by concatenating "tourist attractions in " with the location

#### Step 3: Combine Data

```yaml
- evaluate:
    zipped: |-
      list(
        zip(
          inputs[0].locations,
          [output['result'] for output in outputs[0]],
          outputs[1]
        )
      )
```


This step:
- Combines the data from previous steps into tuples
- Each tuple contains: (location, weather_data, attractions_data)
- Uses Python's `zip` function to align the data

#### Step 4: Generate Itineraries

```yaml
- over: _['zipped']
  parallelism: 3
  # Inside the map step, each `_` represents the current element in the list
  # which is a tuple of (location, weather, attractions)
  map:
    prompt:
    - role: system
      content: >-
        You are {{{{agent.name}}}}. Your task is to create a detailed itinerary
        for visiting tourist attractions in some locations.
        The user will give you the following information for each location:

        - The location
        - The current weather condition
        - The top tourist attractions
    - role: user
      content: >-
        Location: "{{{{_[0]}}}}"
        Weather: "{{{{_[1]}}}}"
        Attractions: "{{{{_[2]}}}}"
    unwrap: true
```


This step:
- Processes up to 3 locations in parallel
- For each location tuple:
  - Sends a prompt to the AI model
  - Includes location, weather, and attraction data
  - Generates a personalized itinerary

#### Step 5: Format Final Output

```yaml
- evaluate:
    final_plan: |-
      '\\n---------------\\n'.join(activity for activity in _)
```


This step:
- Combines all itineraries into a single output
- Separates each itinerary with a divider

## Example Output

An example output when running this task with an input of `["New York", "London", "Paris", "Tokyo", "Sydney"]`:

<div style={{ maxHeight: '400px', overflowY: 'auto', border: '1px solid #ccc', padding: '1rem', borderRadius: '4px' }}>
