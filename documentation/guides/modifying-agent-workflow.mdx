# Modifying Agent Workflow

Julep tasks are flexible workflows that control how an agent operates. This guide shows how to adjust the default behavior.

## 1. Edit the Task YAML

Add, remove, or reorder steps in your task definition. You can insert tool calls, conditional logic, or loops to suit your needs.

## 2. Update Agent Configuration

Point your agent to the new task file or update its task list via the SDK. Your changes apply immediately to new sessions.

## 3. Test Iteratively

Run the task locally or through the API to verify each modification. Adjust prompts and steps until the workflow produces the desired output.
