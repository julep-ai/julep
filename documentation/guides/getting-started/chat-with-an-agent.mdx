# How to Create a Julep Session and Chat with an Agent

This guide will walk you through the process of creating an agent, setting up a session, and engaging in a conversation using the Julep SDKs.

<Info>
This guide is minimalistic and designed to quickly set you up to chat with the agent. It does not cover all the features that Julep agents and sessions provide. For more advanced usage, please check out the [Agents](/docs/concepts/agents) and [Sessions](/docs/concepts/sessions) concepts.
</Info>

## Step 1: Initialize the Julep Client

First, you need to initialize the Julep client with your API key.

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
from julep import Julep

# Initialize the Julep client
julep = Julep(api_key="your_api_key")
```

```javascript Node.js
const julep = require('@julep/sdk');

// Initialize the Julep client
const julep = new Julep({ apiKey: 'your_api_key' });
```
</CodeGroup>

## Step 2: Create an Agent

Create an agent with specific `instructions` and a `model`. This agent will be used in the session.

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
# Create an agent
agent = julep.agents.create(
    name="Chat Buddy",
    about="A friendly and helpful chatbot",
    instructions=[
        "Be friendly and engaging.",
        "Be helpful and provide useful information.",
        "Be concise and to the point.",
        "Do not format your responses. Keep them as plain text.",
    ],
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
)
```

```javascript Node.js
// Create an agent
const agent = await julep.agents.create({
    name: "Chat Buddy",
    about: "A friendly and helpful chatbot",
    instructions: [
        "Be friendly and engaging.",
        "Be helpful and provide useful information.",
        "Be concise and to the point.",
        "Do not format your responses. Keep them as plain text.",
    ],
    model: "gpt-4o-mini",
});
```
</CodeGroup>

## Step 3: Create a Session

Create a session with the agent, specifying a `situation` to provide more context for the session.

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
# Create a session
session = julep.sessions.create(
    agent=agent.id,
    situation="User wants to have a casual chat about hobbies.",
)
```

```javascript Node.js
// Create a session
const session = await julep.sessions.create({
    agent: agent.id,
    situation: "User wants to have a casual chat about hobbies.",
});
```
</CodeGroup>

## Step 4: Chat with the Agent

Send a message with a `user` role to the session to trigger the agent to send a response.

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
# Chat with the agent
response = julep.sessions.chat(
    session_id=session.id,
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Hi there! What are some fun hobbies to try out?"
        }
    ]
)

print("Agent's Response:")
print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

```javascript Node.js
// Chat with the agent
const response = await julep.sessions.chat(
    sessionId: session.id,
    messages: [
        {
            role: "user",
            content: "Hi there! What are some fun hobbies to try out?"
        }
    ]
)
```
</CodeGroup>

## Full Example

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
from julep import Julep

# Initialize the Julep client
julep = Julep(api_key="your_api_key")

# Create an agent
agent = julep.agents.create(
    name="Chat Buddy",
    about="A friendly and helpful chatbot",
    instructions=[
        "Be friendly and engaging.",
        "Be helpful and provide useful information.",
        "Be concise and to the point.",
        "Do not format your responses. Keep them as plain text.",
    ],
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
)

# Create a session
session = julep.sessions.create(
    agent=agent.id,
    situation="User wants to have a casual chat about hobbies.",
)

# Chat with the agent
response = julep.sessions.chat(
    session_id=session.id,
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Hi there! What are some fun hobbies to try out?"
        }
    ]
)
```

```javascript Node.js
const julep = require('@julep/sdk');

// Initialize the Julep client
const julep = new Julep({ apiKey: 'your_api_key' });

// Create an agent
const agent = await julep.agents.create({
    name: "Chat Buddy",
    about: "A friendly and helpful chatbot",
    instructions: [
        "Be friendly and engaging.",
        "Be helpful and provide useful information.",
        "Be concise and to the point.",
        "Do not format your responses. Keep them as plain text.",
    ],
    model: "gpt-4o-mini",
});

// Create a session
const session = await julep.sessions.create({
    agent: agent.id,
    situation: "User wants to have a casual chat about hobbies.",
});

// Chat with the agent
const response = await julep.sessions.chat(
    sessionId: session.id,
    messages: [
        {
            role: "user",
            content: "Hi there! What are some fun hobbies to try out?"
        }
    ]
)
```
</CodeGroup>
