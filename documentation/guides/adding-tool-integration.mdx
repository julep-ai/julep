# Adding a Tool Integration

This guide explains how to connect a new external tool or API to Julep. You will create a small service that wraps the tool and exposes actions that agents can call.

## 1. Create an Integration Service

Use the Julep SDK to define your integration service. Each action should accept structured inputs and return structured outputs.

## 2. Register the Service

Deploy the service and register its OpenAPI specification with your Julep project. The new actions become available to your agents.

## 3. Invoke From a Task

Call the actions from your task steps. The agent can now leverage your custom tool as part of its workflow.
