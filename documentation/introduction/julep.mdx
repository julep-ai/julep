![Julep Simple Overview](/images/julep_overview.svg)

Julep is a platform for creating AI agents that remember past interactions and can perform complex tasks. It offers long-term memory and manages multi-step processes.

Julep enables the creation of multi-step tasks incorporating decision-making, loops, parallel processing, and integration with numerous external tools and APIs.

While many AI applications are limited to simple, linear chains of prompts and API calls with minimal branching, Julep is built to handle more complex scenarios which:

- Have multiple steps,
- Make decisions based on model outputs,
- Spawn parallel branches,
- Use lots of tools, and
- Run for a long time.


Julep offers a comprehensive set of features designed to help you build sophisticated AI workflows. 

<Info>
<p>Imagine you want to build an AI agent that can do more than just answer simple questions â€” it needs to handle complex tasks, remember past interactions, and maybe even use other tools or APIs.</p>
</Info>

Now since you understand the problem Julep is solving, let's explore the key features that make Julep stand out.

## Core Features

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Persistent AI Agents" icon="brain">
    <p>Create agents that maintain context and remember information across multiple interactions. Agents can learn from past conversations and apply that knowledge to future tasks.</p>
  </Card>

  <Card title="Stateful Sessions" icon="database">
    <p>Keep track of conversation history and context across multiple interactions. Sessions can be paused, resumed, and maintain their state indefinitely.</p>
  </Card>

  <Card title="Multi-Step Tasks" icon="arrows-spin">
    <p>Build complex workflows with decision-making capabilities, loops, and conditional logic. Tasks can be as simple or as sophisticated as needed.</p>
  </Card>

  <Card title="Task Management" icon="hourglass">
    <p>Handle long-running tasks that can run indefinitely. Tasks are automatically managed, with built-in support for retries and error handling.</p>
  </Card>

## Advanced Capabilities

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Built-in Tools" icon="wrench" defaultOpen={true}>
    Access a wide range of built-in tools and easily integrate with external APIs. Tools can be added to agents to extend their capabilities.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Self-Healing" icon="bandage" defaultOpen={true}>
    Automatic retry mechanisms for failed steps, message resending, and robust task management keep your workflows running smoothly.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="RAG Support" icon="database" defaultOpen={true}>
    Built-in support for Retrieval-Augmented Generation. Use Julep's document store to build systems that can retrieve and utilize your own data.
  </Accordion>
