# Open Responses API Examples

Below are practical examples showing how to use the Julep Open Responses API for various use cases.

## Basic Setup

First, set up your environment and create a client:

```python
from openai import OpenAI

# Create an OpenAI client pointing to Julep's Open Responses API
client = OpenAI(base_url="http://localhost:8080/", api_key="your_api_key")
```

## Using Reasoning Features

Enhance your model's reasoning capabilities for solving complex problems:

```python
# Create a response with explicit reasoning
reasoning_response = client.responses.create(
    model="o1",
    input="If Sarah has 3 apples and John has 5, and they combine their apples, then how many apples do they have in total? Explain your approach.",
    reasoning={
        "effort": "medium"  # Control reasoning depth with "low", "medium", or "high"
    }
)

# Access the final answer
print(reasoning_response.output_text)
# Output: They would have 8 apples in total. The approach is straightforward: you simply add the number of apples Sarah has (3) to the number of apples John has (5), giving 3 + 5 = 8..
```

## Maintaining Conversation History

Create a continuous conversation by referencing previous responses:

```python
# Reference a previous response to continue a conversation
follow_up_response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    input="What was the final answer?",
    previous_response_id=reasoning_response.id
)

print(follow_up_response.output_text)
```

## Processing Images

Analyze images with multimodal models:

```python
# Create a response that analyzes an image
image_response = client.responses.create(
    # Note: note the use of the Claude 3.5 Haiku model here.
    model="claude-3-5-haiku-20241022",
    input=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": [
                {"type": "input_text", "text": "What is in this image?"},
                {
                    "type": "input_image",
                    "image_url": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dd/Gfp-wisconsin-madison-the-nature-boardwalk.jpg/2560px-Gfp-wisconsin-madison-the-nature-boardwalk.jpg"
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
)

print(image_response.output_text)
# Output: The image shows a wooden boardwalk path through a lush green meadow or grassland. The boardwalk is made of wooden planks and stretches straight ahead, cutting through tall green grass on both sides. In the background, there are trees and vegetation forming a treeline, and the sky is a beautiful blue with wispy white and light blue clouds. The scene appears to be on a bright, sunny day with vibrant colors, suggesting it might be during spring or summer. The landscape looks peaceful and serene, with the boardwalk inviting viewers to explore the natural environment.
```

## Tool Integration with Function Calls

Connect your model to external tools and functions:

```python
# Define tool specifications
tools = [
    {
        "type": "function",
        "name": "get_current_weather",
        "description": "Get the current weather in a given location",
        "parameters": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "location": {
                    "type": "string",
                    "description": "The city and state, e.g. San Francisco, CA",
                },
                "unit": {"type": "string", "enum": ["celsius", "fahrenheit"]},
            },
            "required": ["location", "unit"],
        }
    }
]

# Initial user query
input_messages = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "What's the weather like in Paris today in Celsius?"}]

# Create a response that calls the function
response = client.responses.create(
    model="claude-3-5-haiku-20241022",
    tools=tools,
    input=input_messages,
    tool_choice="auto"
)

# Extract the tool call.
# Note: Use output[0] for openai models, and output[1] for claude models (as claude models return a normal message before the tool call)
tool_call = response.output[1]

# Provide function result back to the model
input_messages.append(tool_call)  # Append model's function call
input_messages.append({           # Append function result
    "type": "function_call_output",
    "call_id": tool_call.call_id,
    "output": str({
        "temperature": 3,
    })
})

# Get final response with weather information
final_response = client.responses.create(
    model="claude-3-5-haiku-20241022",
    input=input_messages,
    tools=tools,
)

print(final_response.output_text)
# Output: It's quite cold in Paris today, with a temperature of 3°C. Make sure to bundle up if you're heading out! The weather is chilly, so a warm coat, scarf, and gloves would be a good idea.
```

## Web Search Integration

Enable your model to search the web for recent information:

```python
# Create a response with web search capability
web_search_response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-4o",
    tools=[{"type": "web_search_preview"}],
    input="What was a positive news story from today?",
)

print(web_search_response.output_text)
```

## Retrieving Past Responses

Access previously created responses by their ID:

```python
# Retrieve a response by ID
retrieved_response = client.responses.retrieve(response_id="your-response-id")
```
