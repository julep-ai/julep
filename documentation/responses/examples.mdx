# Open Responses API Examples

Below are practical examples showing how to use the Julep Open Responses API for various use cases.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="OpenAI's SDK">
    ## Setup

    First, set up your environment and create a client:

    ```python
    from openai import OpenAI

    # Create an OpenAI client pointing to Julep's Open Responses API
    client = OpenAI(base_url="http://localhost:8080/", api_key="your_api_key")
    ```

    ## Using Reasoning Features

    Enhance your model's reasoning capabilities for solving complex problems:

    ```python
    # Create a response with explicit reasoning
    reasoning_response = client.responses.create(
        model="o1",
        input="If Sarah has 3 apples and John has 5, and they combine their apples, then how many apples do they have in total? Explain your approach.",
        reasoning={
            "effort": "medium"  # Control reasoning depth with "low", "medium", or "high"
        }
    )

    # Access the final answer
    print(reasoning_response.output_text)
    # Output: They would have 8 apples in total. The approach is straightforward: you simply add the number of apples Sarah has (3) to the number of apples John has (5), giving 3 + 5 = 8..
    ```

    ## Maintaining Conversation History

    Create a continuous conversation by referencing previous responses:

    ```python
    # Reference a previous response to continue a conversation
    follow_up_response = client.responses.create(
        model="gpt-4o-mini",
        input="What was the final answer?",
        previous_response_id=reasoning_response.id
    )

    print(follow_up_response.output_text)
    ```

    ## Retrieving Past Responses

    Access previously created responses by their ID:

    ```python
    # Retrieve a response by ID
    retrieved_response = client.responses.retrieve(response_id="your-response-id")
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Agents SDK">
    ## Setup

    First, set up your environment and create an async client:

    ```python
    from openai import AsyncOpenAI
    from agents import set_default_openai_client

    # Create and configure the OpenAI client
    custom_client = AsyncOpenAI(base_url="http://localhost:8080/", api_key="your_api_key")
    set_default_openai_client(custom_client)
    ```

    ## Creating a Simple Agent

    Build a basic agent that can respond to user queries:

    ```python
    from agents import Agent, Runner

    # For Jupyter notebooks:
    agent = Agent(
        name="Test Agent",
        instructions="You are a helpful assistant that provides concise responses.",
        model="openrouter/deepseek/deepseek-r1",
    )

    result = await Runner.run(agent, "Hello! Are you working correctly?")
    print(result.final_output)

    # For Python scripts, you'd use:
    # async def test_installation():
    #     agent = Agent(
    #         name="Test Agent",
    #         instructions="You are a helpful assistant that provides concise responses."
    #         model="openrouter/deepseek/deepseek-r1",
    #     )
    #     result = await Runner.run(agent, "Hello! Are you working correctly?")
    #     print(result.final_output)
    #
    # if __name__ == "__main__":
    #     asyncio.run(test_installation())

    # Output: Great to hear! Let me know how I can help you todayâ€”whether it's answering questions, solving problems, or just chatting. ðŸ˜Š
    ```

    ## Web Search Integration

    Create an agent with web search capabilities:

    ```python
    from agents import Agent, Runner, WebSearchTool

    # Create a research assistant with web search capability
    research_assistant = Agent(
        name="Research Assistant",
        instructions="""You are a research assistant that helps users find and summarize information.
        When asked about a topic:
        1. Search the web for relevant, up-to-date information
        2. Synthesize the information into a clear, concise summary
        3. Structure your response with headings and bullet points when appropriate
        4. Always cite your sources at the end of your response
       
        If the information might be time-sensitive or rapidly changing, mention when the search was performed.
        """,
        tools=[WebSearchTool()]
    )


    async def research_topic(topic):
        result = await Runner.run(research_assistant, f"Please research and summarize: {topic}. Only return the found links with very minimal text.")
        return result.final_output

    # Usage example (in Jupyter notebook)
    summary = await research_topic("Latest developments in personal productivity apps.")
    print(summary)

    # Output: Here are some links to the latest developments in personal productivity apps:
    # - [10 Hot Productivity Apps for 2024](https://francescod.medium.com/10-hot-productivity-apps-for-2024-e45e68f2ee22) - Medium
    # - [The Best Productivity Apps in 2025](https://zapier.com/blog/best-productivity-apps/) - Zapier
    # - [The Best Productivity Apps for 2025](https://www.pcmag.com/picks/best-productivity-apps) - PCMag
    ```

    ## Custom Function Tools

    Create an agent with a custom function tool:

    ```python
    import os
    import requests
    from datetime import datetime
    from typing import Optional, List
    from dataclasses import dataclass

    from agents import Agent, Runner, function_tool
    from dotenv import load_dotenv

    load_dotenv()


    @dataclass
    class WeatherInfo:
        temperature: float
        feels_like: float
        humidity: int
        description: str
        wind_speed: float
        pressure: int
        location_name: str
        rain_1h: Optional[float] = None
        visibility: Optional[int] = None


    @function_tool
    def get_weather(lat: float, lon: float) -> str:
        """Get the current weather for a specified location using OpenWeatherMap API.

        Args:
            lat: Latitude of the location (-90 to 90)
            lon: Longitude of the location (-180 to 180)
        """
        # Get API key from environment variables
        WEATHER_API_KEY = os.getenv("OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY")

        # Build URL with parameters
        url = f"https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?lat={lat}&lon={lon}&appid={WEATHER_API_KEY}&units=metric"

        try:
            response = requests.get(url)
            response.raise_for_status()
            data = response.json()

            # Extract weather data from the response
            weather_info = WeatherInfo(
                temperature=data["main"]["temp"],
                feels_like=data["main"]["feels_like"],
                humidity=data["main"]["humidity"],
                description=data["weather"][0]["description"],
                wind_speed=data["wind"]["speed"],
                pressure=data["main"]["pressure"],
                location_name=data["name"],
                visibility=data.get("visibility"),
                rain_1h=data.get("rain", {}).get("1h"),
            )

            # Build the response string
            weather_report = f"""
            Weather in {weather_info.location_name}:
            - Temperature: {weather_info.temperature}Â°C (feels like {weather_info.feels_like}Â°C)
            - Conditions: {weather_info.description}
            - Humidity: {weather_info.humidity}%
            - Wind speed: {weather_info.wind_speed} m/s
            - Pressure: {weather_info.pressure} hPa
            """
            return weather_report

        except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
            return f"Error fetching weather data: {str(e)}"
    ```

    ## Using the Tool with an Agent

    Create an agent that uses the custom function tool:

    ```python
    # Create a weather assistant
    weather_assistant = Agent(
        name="Weather Assistant",
        instructions="""You are a weather assistant that can provide current weather information.
       
        When asked about weather, use the get_weather tool to fetch accurate data.
        If the user doesn't specify a country code and there might be ambiguity,
        ask for clarification (e.g., Paris, France vs. Paris, Texas).
       
        Provide friendly commentary along with the weather data, such as clothing suggestions
        or activity recommendations based on the conditions.
        """,
        tools=[get_weather]
    )

    async def main():
        runner = Runner()

        simple_request = await runner.run(weather_assistant, "What are your capabilities?")
        request_with_location = await runner.run(weather_assistant, "What's the weather like in Tashkent right now?")

        print(simple_request.final_output)
        print("-"*70)
        print(request_with_location.final_output)

    await main()

    # Output: 
    # I'm a weather assistant that can provide you with current weather information. If you ask about the weather for a specific location, I can use a tool to fetch accurate and up-to-date weather data for that place. 
    # 
    # Additionally, I can offer friendly suggestions based on the weather, like what to wear or what activities might be suitable. If the location you mention is ambiguous (like Paris, which could be in France or Texas), I might ask for clarification to ensure I provide you with the correct weather information.
    # ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    # Right now in Tashkent, it's a bit cool with a temperature of 8.84Â°C, feeling slightly cooler at 7.06Â°C. The sky is overcast with lots of clouds, and the humidity is at 76%, so you might feel a bit of dampness in the air. There's a gentle breeze with the wind blowing at 3.09 m/s.
    # 
    # With these conditions, I'd recommend wearing a warm jacket if you're heading out. It's a great day to enjoy indoor activities or perhaps a warm drink at a cozy cafÃ©! Stay comfortable!
