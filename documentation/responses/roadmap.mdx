## Overview

The Julep Responses API is under active development. This page provides a comprehensive overview of implemented features, in-progress development, and planned enhancements.

<Warning>
- Please note that the Julep Responses API is not hosted by Julep. You need to host your own instance of the Julep Responses API to use it. See the [installation guide](/responses/quickstart/#local-installation) for details.
- Being in beta, the Julep Responses API is subject to change. Please check back frequently for the latest updates on feature availability.
- To learn more about the motivations and design principles behind the Julep Responses API, check out the [OpenAI Responses API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/responses) documentation.
