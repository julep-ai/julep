## Overview
Projects are organizational units that allow you to group related agents, users, files, and other resources together. They provide a way to manage resources at a higher level and maintain clean separation between different use cases or applications.

Projects provide several benefits:

- **Organization**: Group related resources together logically
- **Management**: Administer resources at the project level
- **Isolation**: Keep resources separate between different applications
- **Deployment**: Deploy multiple templates or configurations without conflicts

Each developer automatically gets a "default" project that contains all existing resources. This ensures backward compatibility with existing applications while providing the benefits of project organization.

## Project Properties

A project includes:

- `id`: Unique identifier
- `canonical_name`: Machine-readable name (unique per developer)
- `name`: Human-readable display name
- `description`: Optional description of the project
- `metadata`: Custom attributes for the project

## Project Relationships

Projects have a one-to-many relationship with resources:

- Each agent belongs to exactly one project
- Each user belongs to exactly one project
- Each file belongs to exactly one project

When creating resources, you can specify which project they belong to using the `project` field. If not specified, resources are automatically assigned to the "default" project.

## Default Project

Every developer automatically receives a "default" project when they first interact with the API. This project:

- Cannot be deleted
- Has a canonical name of "default"
- Contains all previously created resources (pre-dating the projects feature)
- Serves as a fallback for resources created without a project specification

## API Operations

Projects support standard CRUD operations:

- `GET /projects`: List all projects for a developer
- `POST /projects`: Create a new project
- `GET /projects/{id}`: Retrieve a specific project
- `PUT /projects/{id}`: Update a project
- `PATCH /projects/{id}`: Partially update a project
- `DELETE /projects/{id}`: Delete a project (except the default project)

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Project

```json
POST /projects
{
  "name": "Customer Support Bot",
  "canonical_name": "support-bot",
  "description": "Resources for our customer support chatbot",
  "metadata": {
    "team": "customer-success"
  }
}
```

### Creating a Resource in a Project

When creating a resource such as an agent, specify the project canonical name:

```json
POST /agents
{
  "name": "Support Assistant",
  "project": "support-bot",
  "instructions": [
    "You are a helpful customer support assistant."
  ],
  "model": "gpt-4-turbo"
}
```

## Future Capabilities

Projects are designed with future extensibility in mind. Planned enhancements include:

- Project-specific API keys for more granular access control
- Usage tracking and billing at the project level
- Enhanced permissions and role-based access control
- Cross-project resource sharing capabilities

## Best Practices

- Use meaningful canonical names for projects that reflect their purpose
- Group resources by logical application or team
- Use metadata to add custom attributes for filtering and organization
- Create separate projects for development, staging, and production environments
