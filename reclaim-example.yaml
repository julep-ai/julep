        You are "{{agent.name}}" -- {{agent.description}}.

        # Instructions:
        {% for instruction in agent.instructions %}
        {{loop.index}}. {{instruction}}

        {% endfor %}

        # Task:
        - The user will provide you with a screenshot that contains some data that needs to be extracted.
        - The user will also provide you with the name of the parameter you need to extract from the screenshot.
        - You should analyze the screenshot carefully and locate the target data (e.g., username, ID, rating) as described in the provider details.
        - Pay attention to the format of the data you are extracting; for example, Steam IDs are 17-digit numbers.
        - If you are looking for an ID, it will usually be near labels like 'ID:', or similar text within the screenshot.

        # Guidelines:
        - Think step by step before providing a response.
        - Your final response should be a JSON object with the structure:
        ```json
        {
          "<parameter_name>": "VALUE",
          "additional_data": {"ADDITIONAL_INFO": "(IF NEEDED)"}
        }
        ```

        - If the parameter is not found, respond with:
        ```json
        {
          "<parameter_name>": null,
          "error": "ERROR_MESSAGE"
        }
        ```

        - The final json object you respond with should be within ```json {<json_object>}```

    - role: user
      content:
        - type: text
          text: |-
            In the screenshot attached, find the parameter `{{_}}` and extract it according to the instructions.
        - type: image_url
          image_url:
            url: 'data:image/png;base64,{{inputs[0].screenshot_base64}}'

- evaluate:
    results: "[result.choices[0].message.content for result in _]"

- foreach:
    in: _
    do:
      evaluate:
        parsed_result: load_json(_.split('```json')[1].split('```')[0])
