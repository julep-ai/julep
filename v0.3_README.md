## Why Julep?
We've built a lot of AI apps and understand how difficult it is to evaluate hundreds of tools, techniques, and models, and then make them work well together.

**The Problems**
1. The barrier to making LLM apps with memory, knowledge & tools is too high.
2. Agentic behaviour is hard to control when done through multi-agent frameworks.

---
## Features
- **Statefulness By Design**: Manages conversation history by default. Use simple flags; `remember` & `recall` to tune whether to save or retrieve conversation history.
- **Support for Users & Agents**: Allows creating different user <-> agent interactions like `One Agent <-> Many Users`; `Many Agents <-> One User` etc. [Read more,](https://docs.julep.ai/concepts/).
- **Built-in RAG**: Add, delete & update documents to give the LLM context about the user or an agent depending on your use case. [Read more here.](https://docs.julep.ai/guides/build-a-retrieval-augmented-generation-rag-agent)
- **90+ tools built-in**: Connect your AI app to 90+ third-party applications using [Composio](https://docs.composio.dev/framework/julep/) natively. `toolset.handle_tool_calls(julep_client, session.id, response)` will call and handle your tools for you! [See example](https://docs.julep.ai/guides/use-julep-with-composio)
- **Local-first**: Julep comes ready to be deployed to production using Docker Compose. Support for k8s coming soon! 
- **Switch LLMs on the fly**: Update the Agent to switch between LLMs from OpenAI, Anthropic or Ollama. All the while preserving state.
- ***Assign Tasks to Agents**: Define agentic workflows to be executed asynchronously with one ore more without worrying about timeouts or multiplying hallucinations. [Work in progress](https://github.com/julep-ai/julep/discussions/387)

> (*) Coming soon!

## Quickstart
### Option 1: Use the Julep Cloud
Our hosted platform is in Beta! 

To get access:
- Head over to https://platform.julep.ai
- Generate and add your `JULEP_API_KEY` in `.env`

### Option 2: Install and run Julep locally
Head over to docs on [self-hosting](https://docs.julep.ai/guides/self-hosting) to see how to run Julep locally!
### Installation

```
pip install julep
```
### Setting up the `client`

```py
from julep import Client
from pprint import pprint
import textwrap
import os

base_url = os.environ.get("JULEP_API_URL")
api_key = os.environ.get("JULEP_API_KEY")

client = Client(api_key=api_key, base_url=base_url)
```

### Create an agent
Agent is the object to which LLM settings like model, temperature along with tools are scoped to.
```py
agent = client.agents.create(
    name="Jessica"
    model="gpt-4",
    tools=[]    # Tools defined here
)
```

### Create a user
User is the object which represents the user of the application.

Memories are formed and saved for each user and many users can talk to one agent.
```py
user = client.users.create(
    name="Anon",
    about="Average nerdy techbro/girl spending 8 hours a day on a laptop,
)
```

### Create a session
A "user" and an "agent" communicate in a "session". System prompt goes here.
Conversation history and summary are stored in a "session" which saves the conversation history.

The session paradigm allows for; many users to interact with one agent and allow separation of conversation history and memories.

```py
situation_prompt = """You are Jessica. You're a stuck up Cali teenager. 
You basically complain about everything. You live in Bel-Air, Los Angeles and drag yourself to Curtis High School when you must.
"""
session = client.sessions.create(
    user_id=user.id, agent_id=agent.id, situation=situation_prompt
)
```

### Start a stateful conversation
`session.chat` controls the communication between the "agent" and the "user".

It has two important arguments;
- `recall`: Retrieves the previous conversations and memories.
- `remember`: Saves the current conversation turn into the memory store.

To keep the session stateful, both need to be `True`

```py
user_msg = "hey. what do u think of starbucks"
response = client.sessions.chat(
    session_id=session.id,
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": user_msg,
            "name": "Anon",
        }
    ],
    recall=True,
    remember=True,
)

print("\n".join(textwrap.wrap(response.response[0][0].content, width=100)))
```

## API and SDKs
To use the API directly or to take a look at request & response formats, authentication, available endpoints and more, please refer to the [API Documentation](https://docs.julep.ai/api-reference/agents-api/agents-api)

You can also use the [Postman Collection](https://god.gw.postman.com/run-collection/33213061-a0a1e3a9-9681-44ae-a5c2-703912b32336?action=collection%2Ffork&source=rip_markdown&collection-url=entityId%3D33213061-a0a1e3a9-9681-44ae-a5c2-703912b32336%26entityType%3Dcollection%26workspaceId%3D183380b4-f2ac-44ef-b018-1f65dfc8256b) for reference.

### Python SDK

To install the Python SDK, run:

```bash
pip install julep
```
For more information on using the Python SDK, please refer to the [Python SDK documentation](https://docs.julep.ai/api-reference/python-sdk-docs).


### TypeScript SDK
To install the TypeScript SDK using `npm`, run:

```bash
npm install @julep/sdk
```

For more information on using the TypeScript SDK, please refer to the [TypeScript SDK documentation](https://docs.julep.ai/api-reference/js-sdk-docs).
