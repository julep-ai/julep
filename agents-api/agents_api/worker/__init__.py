The Worker Module for the Agents API

This module is responsible for handling background tasks and jobs for the Agents API application. It provides functionalities for managing memory management tasks, among other background operations, to enhance the application's performance and scalability. The worker module interacts with other components of the application by receiving tasks, processing them asynchronously, and reporting on task completion or errors. This module plays a crucial role in ensuring the application can handle complex operations efficiently without blocking the main execution flow.
