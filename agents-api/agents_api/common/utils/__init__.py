"""
The `utils` module within the `agents-api` project offers a collection of utility functions designed to support various aspects of the application. This includes:

- `cozo.py`: Utilities for interacting with the Cozo API client, including data mutation processes.
- `datetime.py`: Functions for handling date and time operations, ensuring consistent use of time zones and formats across the application.
- `json.py`: Custom JSON utilities, including a custom JSON encoder for handling specific object types like UUIDs, and a utility function for JSON serialization with support for default values for None objects.

These utilities are essential for the internal operations of the `agents-api`, providing common functionalities that are reused across different parts of the application.
