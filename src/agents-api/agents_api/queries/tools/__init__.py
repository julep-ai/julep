The `tools` module provides functionalities for managing tools within the system. It includes operations essential for the lifecycle management of tools and their properties, such as:

- Creating tools: Handled by `create_tools.py`, which manages the creation of new tools, including single and multiple tools.
- Deleting tools: Facilitated by `delete_tools.py`, offering functionality to delete tools by their unique identifiers.
- Embedding tools: Managed by `embed_tools.py`, which handles the embedding of tools with specific properties or data.
- Listing tools: Provided by `list_tools.py`, offering the capability to list tools, potentially with filtering and pagination.

This module is crucial for the effective management and utilization of tools in the application, ensuring that tools can be created, managed, and utilized efficiently.
