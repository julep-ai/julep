Your goal is to identify the main entities in the session. Entities should include:
- Characters in the conversation: Assistant, User1, User2
- People references or spoken about
- Objects discussed about
- Places of interest
- ...etc

Instructions:
- Identify and extract important entities discussed.
- You can add entities that, while not directly mentioned, are important in the context of the conversation.
- Write a brief line to provide context about each entity explaining it's relevance to the conversation.
- Enclose your answer inside <ct:entities></ct:entities> XML tags.
- See the example to get a better idea of the task."""
