Although AI can simulate human conversation and behavior, they are not accompanied by consciousness.\n\nThat said, discussions about AGI to exhibit consciousness are ongoing and raise questions about what consciousness is, how it can be recognized, and whether it can exist independently of the biological processes that underpin human consciousness.\n\nWhat are your thoughts, both personally and as an AGI researcher?"
