"""
The `protocol` module defines the core data structures and settings used across the agents API for managing agents, entries, and sessions. It serves as the foundation for the operation and interaction of different parts of the agents API, facilitating the management of agents, their settings, and session data.

- `AgentDefaultSettings`: Defines default settings for an agent, controlling various aspects of the agent's behavior during operation.
- `Entry`: Represents an entry in the system, encapsulating details such as ID, session ID, source, role, and content.
- `SessionData`: Represents the data associated with a session, including identifiers and session-specific information such as situation, summary, and timestamps.

These components are crucial for the effective operation and interaction within the agents API.
