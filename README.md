  <h3><i>Serverless AI Workflows for Data & ML Teams</i></h3>
</div>

Julep is a serverless platform that helps data and ML teams build sophisticated AI workflows. It provides a robust foundation for orchestrating complex AI operations, managing state across interactions, and integrating with your existing data infrastructure and tools.

Whether you're building data pipelines or creating AI workflows, Julep makes it easy to compose and scale LLM-powered workflows without managing infrastructure. Imagine you want to build an AI agent that can do more than just answer simple questions—it needs to handle complex tasks, remember past interactions, and maybe even use other tools or APIs. That's where Julep comes in. Our platform handles the heavy lifting so you can focus on building intelligent solutions for your business.

💡 To learn more about Julep, check out the **[Documentation](https://docs.julep.ai/docs/introduction/overview)**.

## 🧠 Mental Model

<p align="justify">
Julep is made up of the following components:

- **Julep Platform**: The Julep platform is a cloud service that runs your workflows. It includes a language for describing workflows, a server for running those workflows, and an SDK for interacting with the platform.
- **Julep SDKs**: Julep SDKs are a set of libraries for building workflows. There are SDKs for Python and JavaScript, with more on the way.
- **Julep CLI**: The Julep CLI is a command-line tool that allows you to interact with the Julep platform directly from your terminal.
- **Julep API**: The Julep API is a RESTful API that you can use to interact with the Julep platform.
</p>

<div align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/38420b5d-9342-4c8d-bae9-b47c28ae45af" height="360" />
</div>

<p align="justify">
Think of Julep as a platform that combines both client-side and server-side components to help you build advanced AI agents. Here's how to visualize it:

1. **Your Application Code:**

   - You can use the Julep SDK in your application to define agents, tasks, and workflows.
   - The SDK provides functions and classes that make it easy to set up and manage these components.
   - You can use the Julep CLI to interact with the Julep platform directly from your terminal.

2. **Julep Backend Service:**

   - The SDK communicates with the Julep backend over the network.
   - The CLI communicates with the Julep backend via the SDK.
   - The backend handles execution of tasks, maintains session state, stores documents, and orchestrates workflows.

3. **Integration with Tools and APIs:**
   - Within your workflows, you can integrate external tools and services.
   - The backend facilitates these integrations, so your agents can, for example, perform web searches, access databases, or call third-party APIs.

## 🚀 Quick Start

<p align="justify">

Imagine a Research AI agent that can do the following:

1. **Take a topic**,
2. **Come up with 30 search queries** for that topic,
3. Perform those web **searches in parallel**,
4. **Summarize** the results,
5. Send the **summary to Discord**.
   
</p>

> [!NOTE]
> In Julep, this would be a single task under <b>80 lines of code</b> and run <b>fully managed</b> all on its own. All of the steps are executed on Julep's own servers and you don't need to lift a finger.

Here's a complete example of a task definition:

// Create the task
const task = await client.tasks.create(
  agent.id,
  taskDefinition

// Create the execution
const execution = await client.executions.create(
  task.id,
  {
    input: { 
      "topic": "artificial intelligence",
      "num_questions": 30
    }
  }
);

// Wait for the execution to complete
let result;
while (true) {
  result = await client.executions.get(execution.id);
  if (result.status === 'succeeded' || result.status === 'failed') break;
  console.log(result.status);
  await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));
}

// Print the result
if (result.status === 'succeeded') {
  console.log(result.output);
} else {
  console.error(`Error: ${result.error}`);
}
```
</details>

### 📚 SDK Reference

- **Node.js** [SDK Reference](https://github.com/julep-ai/node-sdk/blob/main/api.md) | [NPM Package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@julep/sdk)
- **Python** [SDK Reference](https://github.com/julep-ai/python-sdk/blob/main/api.md) | [PyPI Package](https://pypi.org/project/julep/)

### 🛠️ API Reference

Explore our API documentation to learn more about agents, tasks, tools, and the Julep CLI here: [API Reference](https://docs.julep.ai/api-reference/)

---

## 💻 Local Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the repository from your preferred source:

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
```

### 2. Navigate to the Root Directory

Change to the root directory of the project:

```bash
cd <repository_root>
```

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

- Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
- Refer to the `.env.example` file for a list of required variables.
- Ensure that all necessary variables are set in the `.env` file.

### 4. Create a Docker Volume for Backup

Create a Docker volume named `grafana_data`, `memory_store_data`, `temporal-db-data`, `prometheus_data`, `seadweedfs_data`:

```bash
docker volume create grafana_data
docker volume create memory_store_data
docker volume create temporal-db-data
docker volume create prometheus_data
docker volume create seadweedfs_data
```

### 5. Run the Project using Docker Compose

You can run the project in two different modes: **Single Tenant** or **Multi-Tenant**. Choose one of the following commands based on your requirement:

1. Single-Tenant Mode

Run the project in single-tenant mode:

```bash
docker compose --env-file .env --profile temporal-ui --profile single-tenant --profile self-hosted-db --profile blob-store --profile temporal-ui-public up --build --force-recreate --watch
```

> **Note:** In single-tenant mode, you can interact with the SDK directly without the need for the API KEY.

2. Multi-Tenant Mode

Run the project in multi-tenant mode:

```bash
docker compose --env-file .env --profile temporal-ui --profile multi-tenant --profile embedding-cpu --profile self-hosted-db --profile blob-store --profile temporal-ui-public up --force-recreate --build --watch
```

> **Note:** In multi-tenant mode, you need to generate a JWT token locally that act as an API KEY to interact with the SDK.

Generate a JWT Token (Only for Multi-Tenant Mode)

To generate a JWT token, `jwt-cli` is required. Kindly install the same before proceeding with the next steps.

Use the following command and replace `JWT_SHARED_KEY` with the corresponding key from your `.env` file to generate a JWT token:

```bash
jwt encode --secret JWT_SHARED_KEY --alg HS512 --exp=$(date -d '+10 days' +%s) --sub '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000' '{}'
```

This command generates a JWT token that will be valid for 10 days.

### 6. Interaction

- **Temporal UI**: You can access the Temporal UI through the specified port in your `.env` file.
- **Julep SDK**: The Julep SDK is a Python/Node.js library that allows you to interact with the Julep API.

```python
from julep import Client

client = Client(api_key="your_jwt_token")
```

**Note:** SDK in Multi-Tenant mode, you need to generate a JWT token locally that acts as an API KEY to interact with the SDK. Furthermore, while initializing the client you will need to set the environment to `local_multi_tenant` and the api key to the JWT token you generated in the previous step. Whereas in Single-Tenant mode you can interact with the SDK directly without the need for the API KEY and set the environment to `local`.

### 7. Troubleshooting

- Ensure that all required Docker images are available.
- Check for missing environment variables in the `.env` file.
- Use the `docker compose logs` command to view detailed logs for debugging.
